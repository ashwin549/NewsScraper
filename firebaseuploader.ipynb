    "    article=\"The Washington Post editorial criticized Trump’s efforts to intimidate the legal profession, but within days, one major law firm, Paul, Weiss, conceded to his pressure. Targeted by an executive order, the firm agreed to provide $40 million in pro bono work and undergo an audit in exchange for retaining its security clearances. Critics view this as a capitulation, while the firm’s chair defended the move as reaffirming its principles.Other law firms, like Perkins Coie and Covington & Burling, have also faced Trump’s scrutiny. Perkins Coie has chosen to fight, winning a temporary court victory, while Covington & Burling has taken a more cautious approach. Losing security clearances poses a major risk to these firms, potentially costing them clients.Beyond law firms, Trump’s critics see a broader effort to stifle dissent, targeting the judiciary, media, and Democratic-aligned organizations. Some Democrats warn that their party is 'under assault' and must unify against Trump’s actions, though they have yet to find a cohesive strategy to counter him.\",\n",
