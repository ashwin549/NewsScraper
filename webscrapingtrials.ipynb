The DOJ lawyer refused to answer many of those questions.\\n\\nLater Monday, the DOJ asked the federal appeals court in D.C. to remove Boasberg from the case, and separately asked Boasberg to vacate his orders.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, a top U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official in a declaration filed in Boasberg\\'s court revealed that a third plane carrying alleged gang members had departed the United States for El Salvador after 7:25 p.m. ET on Saturday, which was after Boasberg had issued an order barring their deportation.\\n\\n\"But all individuals on that third plane had Title 8 final removal orders and thus were not removed solely on the basis of the Proclamation at issue\" in the lawsuit, the declaration said. \"To avoid any doubt, no one on any flight departing the United States after 7:25 PM EDT on March 15, 2025, was removed solely on the basis of the Proclamation at issue.\"\\n\\nThe filing also said that about 54 alleged members of the Venezuelan gang are in detention now, about 172 alleged members are on the non-detained docket, and about 32 are in criminal custody with active detainers against them.\\n\\n\"Should they be transferred to ICE custody, they will likely be placed in removal proceeding,\" the filing said.',\n",

       "  'publish_date': None,\n",
       "  'text': 'Why has Israel bombed Gaza and what next for ceasefire deal?\\n\\n2 hours ago Share Save Emir Nader BBC News, Jerusalem Share Save\\n\\nReuters Many Gazans have fled their homes against after Israel renewed air strikes\\n\\nIsraeli fighter jets unleashed a wave of bombardment across the Gaza Strip through the night, ripping into a fragile truce that has mostly held since it came into effect in January. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu overnight laid the blame at Hamas\\'s door for the renewal of his deadly aerial campaign. The Israeli leader\\'s statement said the military have been instructed to take \"strong action\" against Hamas following their \"repeated refusal to release our hostages\" as well as its rejection of US proposals. In local press, Israeli military sources have also talked about seeing an increase of Hamas activity to regroup their forces in recent days.\\n\\nWhile the truce mostly held until last night, officials at the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza have said that over 140 people have been killed by Israel in the two months since it came into effect in January. In recent weeks, the Israel military has said it\\'s repeatedly struck targets they\\'ve identified as Hamas fighters posing a threat to its troops stationed in Gaza. But the reasons for Netanyahu\\'s decision to return to attacking Hamas is a subject of contention. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has accused the government of \"a complete deception\" by pulling out of a deal \"that could have brought everyone home.\" While some of the prime minister\\'s most staunch critics suggest that the attacks are an attempt by Netanyahu to distract from damaging legal and political crises he faces closer to home. Most critically, there is a fundamental dispute between the Israeli and Hamas sides about who is to blame for the failure of recent efforts to progress the ceasefire.\\n\\nWhat happened to ceasefire talks?\\n\\nThe 19 January ceasefire deal was thrashed out over many months, with US, Qatari and Egyptian mediation, and a detailed three-phase plan for how the truce should move forward. The first phase saw Hamas release 33 hostages in return for Israel releasing around 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and allowing aid and other goods to enter the Gaza Strip. As the guns fell silent and thousands of displaced Gazans returned home, Hamas and Israel were due to begin negotiations to commence the second phase. The parties had agreed that the second phase negotiations would include the release of all remaining hostages as well as a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza Strip, leading to a permanent end to the war. The first phase finished on 1 March, but the negotiations for the next stage had made no progress. Instead, Israel imposed a total halt on all aid entering Gaza causing widespread international alarm - and said that it backed a new proposal put together by the United States. In Qatar last week, Israeli and Hamas delegations gathered to negotiate how the ceasefire would progress and US envoy Steve Witkoff put forward his new \"bridging proposal\" that would have extended the expired first phase. More hostages would return home in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners being released - but, crucially, negotiations over a permanent end to the war would be delayed. Here lies a central element to why the truce has broken down. Israel\\'s two key objectives - to return the hostages and to defeat Hamas - aren\\'t both fully achievable together. Hamas, to put it crudely, has one card to play in the negotiations: the hostages. They don\\'t want to release any further hostages in a next stage of the ceasefire unless it entails Israeli troops beginning to withdraw from the Gaza Strip, as agreed in the original truce. Israel is resisting this. The new, US proposal is an attempt to retrieve more hostages while delaying a commitment to ending the war and the question over whether Hamas will remain in some form. In recent days, the US and Israel have cast Hamas\\'s preference for sticking close to the terms of the original ceasefire deal - instead of renegotiating its terms - as a \"refusal\" to extend the ceasefire. Witkoff accused Hamas of \"publicly claiming flexibility while privately making demands that are entirely impractical without a permanent ceasefire.\" While, in late February, Israeli officials had already briefed local press that its military wouldn\\'t withdraw from key sites in Gaza in a breach of the ceasefire agreement. While we cannot know the detail of the negotiation talks that have taken place behind closed doors - what we do know is that Israel halting aid entering Gaza 17 days ago was an attempt to force Hamas into offering new concessions. That hasn\\'t worked so far and now it appears Israel has returned to violence in order to try to extract a new deal, one that is more favourable for its political leaders, and one that offers fewer wins to Hamas.\\n\\nReuters The Israeli army issued evacuation orders for neighbourhoods across Gaza',\n",

REUTERS/Nathan Howard/File Photo\\n\\nSummary Agencies working to reinstate recently hired employees\\n\\nJudge said mass firings were likely illegal\\n\\nOfficials say reinstatements pose substantial burdens\\n\\nMarch 18 (Reuters) - The Trump administration in court filings has for the first time acknowledged that it fired nearly 25,000 recently hired workers, and said federal agencies were working to bring all of them back after a judge ruled that their terminations were likely illegal.\\n\\nThe filings made in Baltimore, Maryland, federal court late Monday include statements from officials at 18 agencies, all of whom said the reinstated probationary workers were being placed on administrative leave at least temporarily.\\n\\nSign up here.\\n\\nMost of the agencies said they had fired a few hundred workers. The Treasury Department terminated about 7,600 people, the Department of Agriculture about 5,700 and the Department of Health and Human Services more than 3,200, according to the filings.\\n\\nU.S. District Judge James Bredar said on March 13 that the mass firings of probationary workers that began last month violated regulations governing the mass layoffs of federal employees, and ordered them to be reinstated pending further litigation.\\n\\nProbationary workers typically have less than one year of service in their current roles, though some are longtime federal employees.\\n\\nBredar\\'s ruling came in a lawsuit by 19 Democrat-led states and Washington, D.C., who said the mass firings would trigger a spike in unemployment claims and greater demand for social services provided by states.\\n\\nThe office of Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown, which is spearheading the lawsuit, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.\\n\\nThe Trump administration has appealed Bredar\\'s decision and on Monday asked a Richmond, Virginia-based appeals court to pause the ruling pending the outcome of the case.\\n\\nSAN FRANCISCO RULING\\n\\nHours before Bredar issued his ruling, a federal judge in San Francisco had ordered that probationary workers be reinstated at six agencies, including five also covered by Bredar\\'s order and the U.S. Department of Defense. The administration has also appealed that decision.\\n\\nThat judge, U.S. District Judge William Alsup, in an order on Monday criticized the fact that the Trump administration appeared not to be sending fired probationary employees back to work, but is instead placing them on administrative leave. He said that did not comply with his order to reinstate the workers because it would not restore the government services his order intended.\\n\\nAlsup ordered the government agencies that are defendants in the case he is overseeing to state by Tuesday the extent to which previously fired probationary workers are being placed on administrative leave.\\n\\nThe American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union with 800,000 members, which is one of the plaintiffs in the case before Alsup, referred Reuters to his order when asked for comment.\\n\\nIn the Baltimore filings late Monday, agency officials said they had either reinstated all of the fired employees or were working to do so, but warned that bringing back large numbers of workers had imposed significant burdens and caused confusion and turmoil.\\n\\nThe officials also noted that an appeals court ruling reversing Bredar\\'s order would allow agencies to again fire the workers, subjecting them to multiple changes in their employment status in a matter of weeks.\\n\\n\"The tremendous uncertainty associated with this confusion and these administrative burdens impede supervisors from appropriately managing their workforce,\" Mark Green, deputy assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of the Interior, wrote in one of the filings. \"Work schedules and assignments are effectively being tied to hearing and briefing schedules set by the courts.\"\\n\\nBredar has scheduled a hearing for March 26 on whether to keep his ruling in place pending the outcome of the lawsuit, which could take months or longer to resolve.\\n\\nReporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York; Additional reporting by Tim Reid in Washington; Editing by Nick Zieminski, Alexia Garamfalvi and Mark Porter\\n\\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab\\n\\nShare X\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\nLinkedin\\n\\nEmail\\n\\nLink Purchase Licensing Rights',\n",

       "  'publish_date': None,\n",
       "  'text': 'As the lawsuits filed against President Donald Trump have climbed well past the triple-digit mark less than three months into his presidency, some supporters are questioning what actions – if any – can either members of Congress or the White House take to check the power of the courts.\\n\\nTrump\\'s supporters have criticized so-called \"activist\" judges who have ruled against Trump. Notably, some have labeled U.S. Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Trump appointee, as such after she sided with Chief Justice John Roberts and left-leaning justices to uphold a lower court decision that forced the Trump administration to unfreeze USAID payments previously authorized by Congress.\\n\\nMore recently, the White House contested a federal judge\\'s order blocking the administration from using a 1798 wartime law to deport Venezuelan nationals, including alleged members of the violent gang Tren de Aragua. When U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg ordered the Trump administration to turn around any plane carrying deported foreign nationals, the administration sent hundreds of deportees to El Salvador anyway, seemingly in defiance of the judge.\\n\\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News later that the plane in question had already \"left U.S. airspace\" and later added that the administration should not need to comply with the judge\\'s order.\\n\\nWHO IS JAMES BOASBERG, THE US JUDGE AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP\\'S DEPORTATION EFFORTS?\\n\\n\"The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist [Tren de Aragua] aliens had already been removed from U.S. territory,\" Leavitt said, adding, \"A single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft carrier full of foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from U.S. soil.\"\\n\\nBoasberg ordered the parties back to court Monday for a hearing over the matter and set a Tuesday deadline for the Justice Department to provide the court with more information about what happened. However, Trump\\'s apparent defiance of the court demonstrates how the executive branch is looking to push back against judges whose opinions it does not respect, while supporters in Congress cheer on.\\n\\n\"Judges targeting President Trump are political hacks and their decisions belong in my SHREDDER,\" Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., wrote on X last week, sharing a video that criticized another judge, U.S. District Judge Amir Ali. Ogles called Ali a \"Biden-appointed, woke judicial activist\" after the judge, following the Supreme Court\\'s guidance, ordered the government to pay nearly $2 billion in \"unlawfully\" restricted USAID funds.\\n\\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, a frequent critic of the courts, shared Ogles\\' post and wrote, \"Judges aren\\'t presidents.\" Lee, in recent weeks, suggested that some judges handing down defeats for the Trump administration \"might warrant removal.\"\\n\\nFEDERAL JUDGE ORDERS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO PAY ‘UNLAWFULLY’ RESTRICTED USAID FUNDS\\n\\nCongress indeed has the power to impeach and remove federal judges for misconduct, corruption or other offenses – Trump has called for Congress to do so – but two-thirds of the Senate would need to vote in favor of removal, and Democrats are unlikely to join Republicans in any such effort.\\n\\nMany judges, for their part, have taken umbrage at the sweeping nature of Trump\\'s executive orders, which have called for the gutting of government personnel, halted billions in foreign aid – including funds approved by Congress – and attempted to unilaterally end birthright citizenship, among other actions.\\n\\n\"An American President is not a king – not even an \\'elected\\' one – and his power to remove federal officers and honest civil servants like plaintiff is not absolute,\" U.S. District Court Judge Beryl Howell said earlier this month in a court order reinstating a member of the National Labor Relations Board.\\n\\nConstitutional scholars say these separation of powers conflicts long predate Trump and are somewhat expected because of the recent lack of action from the United States Congress.\\n\\nArticle I empowers Congress to \"make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper\" for the executive branch to function. However, when lawmakers focus more on their re-election campaigns or partisan fighting than enacting law, there is a vacuum that is filled by executive action – which faces tough scrutiny from the courts.\\n\\nHERE\\'S WHY DOZENS OF LAWSUITS SEEKING TO QUASH TRUMP\\'S EARLY ACTIONS AS PRESIDENT ARE FAILING\\n\\nCongress passed slightly fewer than 150 bills during the 118th session, according to data compiled by the firm Quorum and reported by Axios – making that session, which ended in December, the most unproductive since at least the 1980s.\\n\\nRecent presidents, including former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, have responded with a flurry of executive orders and actions to enact their agenda, analysts explained to Fox News Digital in an interview.\\n\\nAccording to the Code of Federal Regulations and the Federal Register, a president’s executive order can be revoked or modified only by the president or via the legislative branch, if the president was acting on authority that had been granted by Congress. In the Trump era, lawsuits have alleged that Trump has acted without authorization from Congress.\\n\\nIn the absence of clearly written laws, judges wield enormous power to interpret the lawfulness of the executive\\'s action and have done so. Critics of the judiciary have advocated for Congress to curtail this power by either changing the size or structure of certain lower courts or taking similar action.\\n\\nHarvard Law professor Adrian Vermeule opined in a social media post Thursday that Congress, with its Republican majorities in the House and Senate, could simply move to cut off funding for judicial law clerks and other essential legal personnel, making the legislative branch\\'s \"power of the purse\" painfully clear.\\n\\n\"If Congress simply refused to fund judicial law clerks, secretaries, or computers, one suspects that the TROs would come out more slowly - and perhaps even that the judiciary would gain a renewed appreciation for the limits of its role,\" Vermeule wrote on X.\\n\\nHowever, given Congress\\'s difficulty in passing legislation, including days of infighting that have delayed the passage of recent stopgap spending bills, it is unclear how effective lawmakers of either party would be at rallying behind a measure like the one he proposed.\\n\\nOptions available to the White House are more limited by the Constitution. The president can appoint federal judges, but he cannot fire them. The executive branch is also responsible for enforcing court rulings and may either slow-roll or de-prioritize decisions the president disagrees with. However, such an action would violate historical deference given to the courts, although Trump now seems to be willing to do so.\\n\\nJUDGE BLOCKS TRUMP ADMIN FROM TARGETING DEMOCRATIC LAW FIRM AFTER ATTORNEYS WARN OF FIRM\\'S DEMISE\\n\\nAfter the Supreme Court upheld a district court\\'s decision this month ordering the Trump administration to pay nearly $2 billion in owed payments to USAID contractors for completed projects, Judge Ali said in his ruling that the Trump administration likely exceeded its constitutional authority in attempting to block the payments.\\n\\n\"Here, the executive has unilaterally deemed that funds Congress appropriated for foreign aid will not be spent,\" Ali said.\\n\\n\"The executive not only claims his constitutional authority to determine how to spend appropriated funds, but usurps Congress’ exclusive authority to dictate whether the funds should be spent in the first place.\" Ali added.\\n\\nHowever, it is unclear what remedies the White House would have unilaterally to push back on the decision, short of appealing certain portions to the Supreme Court that were not ruled on directly – prompting criticism from some.\\n\\nAs president, Trump \"is exercising Article II power to take care that our federal laws are faithfully executed,\" Mike Davis, the founder and president of the Article III Project, or A3P, told Fox News Digital in an interview.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n\"That\\'s his constitutional duty. And that includes weeding out waste, fraud and abuse. That’s what he\\'s doing with Elon Musk and with DOGE,\" said Davis, a former Supreme Court clerk for Justice Neil Gorsuch.\\n\\nIt is unclear whether the White House plans to appeal any part of Judge Ali\\'s preliminary injunction ruling, and administration officials did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital\\'s request for comment.',\n",

       "  'text': 'President Donald Trump visited the Kennedy Center on Monday, where he presided over a meeting of its refashioned board of trustees and discussed changes to the institution’s annual Honors, including possibly hosting the ceremony himself. “I’ve been so busy, I haven’t been able to be here for a long time,” Trump, who is the board’s chairman, said at the beginning of the meeting. “And I shouldn’t be, with what I’m doing.”\\n\\nThe Washington Post obtained audio of the meeting, in which the board voted to expand the committee that chooses Kennedy Center honorees. Trump and board members floated names such as Paul Anka, Sylvester Stallone, Johnny Mathis and Andrea Bocelli for the award.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe president also suggested giving awards to Elvis Presley, Luciano Pavarotti and Babe Ruth, though the Kennedy Center Honors are not given posthumously. Pavarotti was honored in 2001. Trump floated expanding the event to include politicians, executives and athletes.\\n\\n“Elvis sells better as a dead man,” Trump said.\\n\\nDuring the board meeting, Trump railed against previous Kennedy Center Honors, saying, “In the past, I mean, these are radical left lunatics that have been chosen. I didn’t like it. I couldn’t watch it. And the host was always terrible.”\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nIt is unclear how many members will be added to the committee. Their identities are also unknown. “We’re expanding the committee so that the search for the Kennedy Center Honors is more inclusive,” said one board member, who could not be identified by voice alone.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHonorees are chosen by a Special Honors Advisory Committee, primarily composed of former honorees and some of the center’s trustees. The general public can make recommendations.\\n\\nTrump seemed to say he would agree to be the ceremony’s host. “I don’t want to, but I want this thing to be successful,” he told the board. Queen Latifah hosted last year’s ceremony.\\n\\nThe Kennedy Center Honors, which began in 1978, is the center’s premier event. The awards are given to artists who made “an impact on the rich tapestry of American life and culture through the performing arts,” according to the center.\\n\\nIt has always been a bipartisan event. During the show, held in December, the honorees watch as their peers pay homage to their careers from the stage of the 2,364-seat Opera House on the Potomac River. The president typically sits next to them.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTrump, however, broke tradition by not attending the event during his first term. During the first year of Trump’s presidency, Norman Lear, a 2017 honoree, announced he would boycott the White House reception ahead of the ceremony.\\n\\n“We’ll go slightly more conservative, if you don’t mind, with some of the people,” Trump said, referring to future honorees. It is unclear what role he would have in influencing who is chosen. “There are people out there that would not be considered that are much bigger stars than the ones that were being honored.”\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\n“Just get some good people, some people who are worthy,” Trump added. “Because some of the people that they put on are just, just terrible.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nPrevious honorees include Johnny Carson, Steven Spielberg, Paul McCartney, George Clooney, U2, Tom Hanks, Sting, Al Pacino, Mavis Staples and James Taylor.\\n\\nLast year, the honorees included filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola, blues-rock star Bonnie Raitt, Cuban American trumpeter and composer Arturo Sandoval, psychedelic trailblazers the Grateful Dead and the influential Apollo Theater in New York. The previous class was made up of actor Billy Crystal, opera star Renée Fleming, pop singers Barry Gibb and Dionne Warwick, and rapper and actress Queen Latifah.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nTrump also floated the idea of having networks bid on carrying the honors. The show has been broadcast on CBS since its debut.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSpeaking to reporters before the meeting, Trump said the money given to the Kennedy Center “has not been properly spent.” He said he hopes to bring in Broadway shows. (The center routinely books tours of Broadway productions.)\\n\\nLater, Trump and board members mentioned several shows they would be interested in bringing, including “Hello, Dolly!” “Phantom of the Opera,” “Camelot,” “Fiddler on the Roof” and “Cats.”\\n\\nOne board member, unidentifiable by voice alone, said the center will be booking non-equity shows, which “make a lot more money.” Non-equity shows are not produced or performed by members of the Actors’ Equity Association, a labor union representing those in live theater.\\n\\nAt other points during the meeting, Trump shared personal stories and anecdotes, including about the first time he saw “Cats” and which members of the cast he found attractive. He also spoke about how dangerous the Potomac River can be. The center is adjacent to the river.\\n\\nLast month, Trump terminated every member of the Kennedy Center board of trustees appointed by President Joe Biden and replaced them with loyalists, including the director of the White House’s Presidential Personnel Office, Sergio Gor, and deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHe also fired chairman David M. Rubenstein, who was appointed to the board by President George W. Bush and reappointed by Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nThe board then voted to make Trump chairman. It also fired the center’s president, Deborah Rutter, and installed Trump ally Richard Grenell, the former acting director of national intelligence and U.S. ambassador to Germany, as the interim president.\\n\\nThe Kennedy Center is “in tremendous disrepair, as is a lot of the rest of our country,” Trump told reporters before the board meeting. “Most of it, because of bad management. This is a shame, what I’ve watched and witnessed.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMembers of Trump’s team have spent recent weeks scoping out the imposing Foggy Bottom building, which opened in 1971. They found the center “filthy,” as one White House official told The Washington Post on Monday, speaking on the condition of anonymity to share findings that the official was not authorized to discuss publicly.\\n\\n“I saw rats,” the official said. “It smelled like vomit.”\\n\\nAnother Trump adviser said the Kennedy Center was clearly in need of repairs, accusing previous leaders of neglecting basic upkeep. That adviser also spoke on the condition of anonymity to share observations the official was not authorized to discuss publicly.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nThe center completed a $250 million expansion in 2019, adding a building called the Reach to its campus.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMultiple Kennedy Center staff members, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared retribution, said the center does have mice and could be better cleaned, but they pushed back against the severity of the team’s report. “They’re angling to say [the center] doesn’t use the federal facilities funds properly,” one staffer suggested.\\n\\nThe Kennedy Center is funded by a mix of government-appropriated funding, private donations and ticket sales revenue. Its operating budget in 2024 was $268 million. Of that, roughly $125 million came from earned revenue, such as ticket sales, $95 million from private donations and fundraising, and $45 million from federal appropriations, with another $4 million drawn from its endowment.\\n\\nThe federal funds are for the upkeep and maintenance of the building.\\n\\nMonday was also the first day all Kennedy Center employees were required to return to the office after five years of being able to work remotely, though it was closed to the public.\\n\\nAhead of the meeting, Kennedy Center workers received an email informing them of an “increased security presence.” Portraits of Trump, first lady Melania Trump (an honorary chair of the board of trustees), Vice President JD Vance and Usha Vance (who is on the board of trustees) were installed in the Hall of Nations.\\n\\nThe Vances recently attended a performance by the National Symphony Orchestra at the center, where they were booed while taking their seats. The next day, Grenell sent an all-staff email stating that he “received several messages from Kennedy Center staffers sharing their embarrassment over more than a few Symphony patrons loudly booing the Vice President and his wife last night.”\\n\\nHe cited the center’s diversity as a strength and urged tolerance for different political views. “As President, I take diversity and inclusion very seriously,” he wrote. “I have met with many of you, and I love that we are Christian, Muslim, Jewish, agnostic, gay, straight, black, white, Hispanic and absolutely different.”\\n\\nAfter Trump’s takeover, several artists canceled performances at the Kennedy Center, including actress, comedian and television producer Issa Rae, author Louise Penny and musician Rhiannon Giddens.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nRecently, the Tony- and Pulitzer Prize-winning musical “Hamilton” canceled upcoming performances. Its producer, Jeffrey Seller, announced March 5 that the show was not compatible with “a new spirit of partisanship ... [at] the national treasure that is the Kennedy Center.”\\n\\n“Given these recent actions, our show simply cannot, in good conscience, participate and be a part of this new culture that is being imposed on the Kennedy Center,” Seller said. The musical by Lin-Manuel Miranda was originally scheduled for its third run at the center next year, from March 3 to April 26.\\n\\n“I never liked ‘Hamilton’ very much,” Trump said Monday.',\n",

The new parliament, elected last month, no longer has a supermajority that would have backed the measures.\\n\\nMerz, who had previously refused to change the country’s constitutional borrowing limit, justified his sudden U-turn by the rapidly deteriorating transatlantic relationship and the growing threat from Russia.\\n\\nWithin hours of winning the elections last month, Merz declared Germany had to end a decades-long reliance on Washington, saying US President Donald Trump was “largely indifferent” to Europe’s fate.\\n\\n“It must be an absolute priority to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we actually achieve independence from the US,” he said then.\\n\\nBut in the wake of federal elections he realised he had a problem: the far-right Alternative for Germany and far-left Die Linke together hold more than a third of the seats in the new Bundestag and would have voted against Merz’s reform.\\n\\nThe incoming chancellor’s main push is to exempt most defence spending from the “debt brake” enshrined in the constitution in 2009.\\n\\nThe rule limits the federal government’s structural deficit to 0.35 per cent of GDP, adjusted for the economic cycle, and in effect prohibits the 16 federal states from running any deficits at all.\\n\\nThe constitutional changes should also secure a two-thirds majority in the Bundesrat, the chamber that represents the country’s states, after Bavaria indicated it would vote in favour.\\n\\nDuring the four-hour long debate on Tuesday, critics accused Merz of burdening future generations with a massive debt load. AfD co-leader Tino Chrupalla invoked former CDU finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble, mentor of Merz and champion of a balanced budget.\\n\\nChrupalla said: “Your former finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, advocated investing only the money that was in the budget. And what do you actually stand for, Mr Merz?”\\n\\nBoris Pistorius, the current SPD defence minister, argued Russia, which had become “Europe’s greatest security threat”, justified the ambitious reform to keep modernising the Bundeswehr.\\n\\n“We are not selling the future, as you would have us believe in your religious zeal for the debt brake. We are securing the future,” Pistorius said. “The threat situation is more pressing than the cash situation.”\\n\\nThe Greens, which agreed to back Merz’s reforms after some bargaining last week, vowed to keep the future chancellor in check to ensure responsible spending.\\n\\n“We will make sure that this money is now really invested sensibly for a functioning infrastructure, for our security, for Ukraine, for climate protection,” said Green co-leader Franziska Brantner.\\n\\nShe invoked postwar CDU chancellor Konrad Adenauer who signed the Rome Treaty that founded the European Economic Community in 1957.\\n\\n“Mr Merz, this could be an Adenauer moment for you. You could seize the opportunity to write a new chapter in European integration,” she said. “Germany is a great country. Make something out of it.”',\n",

It said the allegations were being investigated. No one was identified.\\n\\nThe nine-member team, which includes scientists, a doctor and engineers, is expected to stay at the base for about 13 months until next year, authorities said, living in close quarters through the hostile Antarctic winter, whose six months of darkness begin in June.\\n\\nThe base is on a cliff in Queen Maud Land and is surrounded by a glacial ice sheet, more than 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles) from South Africa.\\n\\nThe next planned visit by a supply ship is in December, according to the South African National Antarctic Program. It takes the ship around 10 days to travel from Cape Town.\\n\\nAuthorities said they had decided not to evacuate anyone from SANAE IV, where the onset of unpredictable weather conditions meant the team was now confined to the base.\\n\\nThe ministry said all team members had undergone evaluations ahead of the trip to ensure they are able to cope with the “extreme nature of the environment in Antarctica” and the isolation and confinement, and no problems were identified.\\n\\n“It is not uncommon that once individuals arrive at the extremely remote areas where the scientific bases are located, an initial adjustment to the environment is required,” it said.\\n\\nPrevious problems have been reported at another of South Africa’s remote research bases on Marion Island, a South African territory near Antarctica.\\n\\nIn 2017, a member of a research team there smashed a colleague’s room with an ax over an apparent love triangle, according to a report to South Africa’s Parliament. Lawmakers said it appeared the researchers were living in highly stressful conditions.\\n\\nThe National Science Foundation, the federal agency that oversees the U.S. Antarctic Program, published a report in 2022 in which 59% of women in the U.S. program said they’d experienced harassment or assault while on research trips in Antarctica.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa',\n",

       "  'publish_date': None,\n",
       "  'text': '(Bloomberg) -- This isn’t the Fed’s stock market anymore.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nFor years, Federal Reserve meetings have been the main event on Wall Street as the central bank fought to contain runaway inflation. Traders carefully parsed the wording of each interest rate statement, the positioning of the dot plot, and Chair Jerome Powell’s comments in his post-meeting press conference, while portfolio managers sized up how to play the market based on this new guidance.\\n\\nBut as the Fed starts its latest two-day meeting, the focus has shifted. High interest rates are no longer the main fear. Rather, investors are worried about slowing growth and trade disruptions from President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which briefly pushed the S&P 500 Index into a correction last week. While the Fed still has the stock market’s undivided attention, what Wall Street wants to hear from Powell now is his read on the economy — and how the Fed can stay nimble in the face of a slowdown.\\n\\n“We are out of the era of Fed watching,” said Jeff Blazek, co-chief investment officer for multi-asset strategies at Neuberger Berman. “Yes, we should be aware of the possible increase in inflation. But we are far more focused on the growth implications from potential demand destruction as prices go up due to tariffs.”\\n\\nFor example, signs of cooling inflation last week in the consumer price index and producer price index barely caused a ripple in the stock market, which was busy swinging on tariff headlines. Meanwhile, the growth scare is tangible: A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. basket of stocks that thrive during stagflation is up 14% over the past month while the S&P 500 is down 7.4%.\\n\\nOptions market traders are pricing in a 1.2% move in the S&P 500 in either direction on Wednesday, when the Fed announces its rate decision and Powell holds his press conference, up from an average of 0.8% for Fed Days over the past year, according to data from Stuart Kaiser, Citibank’s head of US equity trading strategy. However, since traders also see virtually no chance of a rate cut at this meeting, the move would likely be based on what Powell and his colleagues say about the economy and risks from here.\\n\\nTariff Tremors\\n\\nIn particular, traders are antsy about the looming April 2 deadline for the Trump administration to impose broad reciprocal tariffs and additional sector-specific levies. A gauge of implied price swings in the S&P 500 in the next 30 days is trading above the expected volatility two months from now, meaning traders are betting on higher levels of volatility soon.',\n",

One of them, Sahil Karoul, provides a comprehensive look at the phone. While the narration in his video isn't in English, the visuals more than compensate, offering a full 360-degree view of the device's design.\\n\\nIf you'd prefer something a little more comprehensible, The Mobile Central has you covered with their own hands-on. This one's in English and dishes out all the details, like the Pixel 9a flaunting a plastic rear, packing a 6.3-inch 120Hz OLED display, and a massive 5,100mAh battery under the hood.\\n\\nThe Pixel 9a is also reportedly set to receive seven years of software updates, putting it on par with the rest of the Pixel 9 lineup – and, of course, the Pixel 8a.\\n\\nIn terms of design, the Pixel 9a marks a significant departure from its predecessors. The iconic camera visor is gone, replaced by a flush rear panel that virtually eliminates any camera bump.\\n\\nThe overall aesthetic is flatter and more streamlined, featuring an iPhone-esque squared-off metal frame. Despite the plastic rear panel, it sports a matte finish for a premium feel. The device also boasts an IP68 water resistance rating.\\n\\nThe front, however, doesn't look quite as modern, with the display being surrounded by some rather chunky bezels.\\n\\nThe leaked videos also provide a glimpse of the Pixel 9a's performance. The new Tensor G4 chip appears to hold its own in benchmarks and gaming sessions without overheating. We even get a preview of the camera's capabilities.\\n\\nAll in all, while the Pixel 9a may not introduce any major surprises beyond its revamped design, the combination of a more efficient Tensor chip and that sizable battery could result in impressive battery life. But we'll have to wait for fuller reviews before passing any verdicts.\",\n",

Fellow analyst Ming-Chi Kuo was first to reveal that this was Apple\\'s plan last year.\\n\\nPu believes Apple\\'s second-generation C2 modem will debut in the iPhone 18 Pro models next year, which is also something that has already been rumored previously. Look for the C2 modem to be faster overall, and for it to gain mmWave support in the United States. Further power efficiency improvements are likely too.\\n\\niPhone 17 Pro models are expected to have Qualcomm modems still.\\n\\nApple\\'s modem supply agreement with Qualcomm runs through March 2027, so the company still has time to transition to its own custom-designed modems. Apple develops chips several years before they ship, so it should come as no surprise that the company is reportedly already working on its next-generation C2 and C3 modems.\\n\\nApple said the C1 modem is already the most power-efficient iPhone modem ever, and it held up fine in both real-world and simulated 5G speed test results.',\n",

       "  'publish_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 3, 18, 2, 27, 47, 785000, tzinfo=tzoffset(None, -14400)),\n",
       "  'text': 'Photo: Courtesy of Netflix\\n\\nAdolescence opens with a dramatic arrest: 13-year-old Jamie (Owen Cooper) is accused of stabbing his classmate, Katie, to death. The four-part British series — which dropped on Netflix on March 13 and topped the streaming platform’s most-watched show list that weekend, according to the BBC — already has famous fans. Paul Feig praised the first episode as “one of the best hours of television” he’s ever seen, while Jeremy Clarkson joined viewers in expressing amazement and confusion over the show’s use of a drone in the second episode. (Every episode of Adolescence is shot in one continuous take.) But it’s not just the technology that the internet is curious about. Many people online are also wondering whether this crime drama is a work of true-crime. Andrew Tate is name-dropped, and he’s real whether we like it or not — but is the main murder plot of this series also based in reality? Below, what co-creator and star Stephen Graham has said about the inspiration behind Adolescence.\\n\\nDoes Jamie have a real-life counterpart?\\n\\nNot directly. Jamie’s story itself is not based on a specific person or event, but per Birmingham Live, Graham noted that real reports of knife crime did give him the idea for what the series would be about. “I’d read an article in the paper about a young boy stabbing a young girl, and it made me feel a bit cold,” he said. “Then about three of four months later, there was a piece on the news about a young boy who’d stabbed a young girl.”\\n\\nHe told Tudum that learning about that first stabbing “shocked” him and made him wonder what was going on in society. “And then it happened again, and it happened again, and it happened again,” he recalled. “I really just wanted to shine a light on it, and ask, ‘Why is this happening today? What’s going on? How have we come to this?’ ”\\n\\nSo, youth knife attacks are a concern in the U.K.?\\n\\nYes, and increasingly so. Graham told The Hollywood Reporter that there is an “epidemic of knife crime amongst young, young lads … up and down the country.” According to the Office for National Statistics, the number of knife attacks in England and Wales has almost doubled in the past 10 years. Meanwhile, Ministry of Justice data for the year ending in March 2023 shows that 17.3% of the roughly 18,500 cautions and convictions made for possession of a knife or offensive weapon were offenders ages 10 to 17.\\n\\nAdolescence’s release follows the January sentencing of an 18-year-old to at least 52 years in prison for killing three young girls last summer at a Taylor Swift-themed dance event in Southport when he was 17. The series was “conceived and written months before” that attack, according to Entertainment Weekly, but the subject material unfortunately continues to feel timely. The Official for National Statistics reported in February that 83% of teenage homicide victims in England and Wales were stabbed to death during the year ending in March 2024; according to the BBC, the data showed that teens were more likely to be killed with a sharp instrument over any other age group. As recently as last week, an 18-year-old was sentenced to at least 23 years in prison for fatally stabbing a 15-year-old girl in London when he was 17.\\n\\nDo we know anything about the inspiration for Jamie’s parents?\\n\\nGraham has not named any specific direct inspirations, but he has said that his own reaction to knife attacks shaped the way that Jamie’s parents, played by himself and Christine Tremarco, is portrayed in the series. He told The Hollywood Reporter that people “blame the mom and dad” when they hear this type of news involving kids from “council estates,” or British public housing. He admitted that he himself is sometimes “guilty” of falling into this line of thinking. However, he told Rolling Stone UK and Drama Quarterly that questioning that initial instinct made him decide to focus on what was happening with Jamie and not have the parents be violent or alcoholics. “I wanted the dad to be a hardworking man,” Graham noted, “the kind of man that I was brought up with, like my uncles and my dad, who used to go to work at, like, six in the morning and not get home till 8 o’clock at night, Monday to Friday.”\\n\\nAnd was that an Andrew Tate reference?\\n\\nYup. Much to the displeasure of some of his fans, Adolescence name-drops self-proclaimed misogynist and far-right star Andrew Tate when a detective brings up the potential role of the involuntary celibacy subculture. In GQ, Graham credited co-writer and co-creator Jack Thorne for coming up with the “incel stuff” in the series and doing research about online radicalization.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Graham first learned about Tate through his kids. “I was looking online at a workout thing that our [son] Alfie sent me, and it was a good workout,” he told Rolling Stone UK. “Three or four days later, the algorithm — which I don’t understand — showed me the same gentleman again, and he was telling me his misogynistic opinions and views.” In his GQ interview, Graham added that his daughter Grace was the one who then identified Tate and explained who he was. “And then I thought, Well, I’m a semi-put-together 51-year-old man who knows a little bit of who I am and what I’m about,” he said. “So what if I was a 13-year-old boy who didn’t have the greatest relationship with my father, didn’t really have that solid connection with a role model, and was finding my feet out there?”',\n",

Yes, I know they've lost three of their past four games. Yes, I know no team has ever won the NCAA Tournament after losing three-of-four games just before Selection Sunday. But Bruce Pearl has been making history his whole life, and I won't be surprised if he does it again. Auburn will cut nets in San Antonio. Johni Broome will be the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player.\\n\\nMatt Norlander\\n\\nOver the past five seasons, it's fair to say no program has been more consistent, more rugged, more stubbornly successful to win on their terms than Kelvin Sampson's Cougars. Two years removed from a top-seeded Houston team having a chance to win it all in their home city, I've got UH finishing the job in 2025 in its home state. My reason: Great coaches — often, though not always — reached the mountaintop. Sampson is a great coach. This team is the best offense and has the 3-point attack, by far, of any team he's had. From Joseph Tugler's defense to J'Wan Roberts' brute presence to LJ Cryer, Emanuel Sharp and Milos Uzan's sharpshooting capabilities, all the pieces are in place for the Coogs to celebrate in San Antonio.\\n\\nKyle Boone\\n\\nThere is an obvious unknown here with Duke after star freshman Cooper Flagg — the favorite to win National Player of the Year, the frontrunner to be the No. 1 NBA Draft pick and the all-everything for the Blue Devils — went down in the ACC Tournament with an ankle sprain. But if Flagg can nurse himself back to full health or something close to full health as Duke makes a run, then I'm simply betting on the team I think has the most talent led by the best player in the sport. That can take the Blue Devils the distance and I'm projecting it will. Duke won 31 games leading into the NCAA Tournament and 26 of its last 27 games. It did not have the resume of No. 1 overall seed Auburn — which Duke beat during that run — but it has been the best team in college basketball for much of that span. Of course, the best team doesn't always emerge from the bracket, but in this case I think Duke can do it.\\n\\nDavid Cobb\\n\\nFlorida is entering the NCAA Tournament after a dominant tear through the SEC Tournament that capped an impressive season for a team that has no obvious weaknesses. The Gators have elite guards and a convoy of high-motor bigs who are relentless on the boards. After grinding through the SEC, the Gators won't flinch in potential matchups with two-time reigning national champion UConn or with St. John's and legendary coach Rick Pitino. Florida has everything it needs to win it all, including a ton of momentum entering the tournament.\\n\\nGet every pick, every play, every upset and fill out your bracket with our help! Visit SportsLine now to see which teams will make and break your bracket, and see who will cut down the nets, all from the model that beat over 91% of CBS Sports brackets players four of the last six tournaments.\\n\\nJerry Palm\\n\\nFlorida is on a heater entering the NCAA Tournament coming off a dominant performance in the SEC tournament. Winners of 12 of their last 13 games, all but three by double-digit margins, the Gators look every bit the part of a national champion. Their last six wins are all Quad 1 games. They will probably find the first few rounds of the NCAA Tournament to be easier than what they are used to seeing night in and night out in the league. Walter Clayton Jr. leads a balanced scoring attack in which six players average 8 ppg. It is going to take a very good team on a very good day to take down Florida.\\n\\nDennis Dodd\\n\\nThe difference in Houston this season is balance. To go along with the nation's best scoring defense is an effective offense. The Cougars are top 20 in three-point shooting. The trio of L.J. Cryer, Milos Uzan and Emanuel Sharp are actually one of the better scoring forces in the tournament. Uzan just came off a career-hgh 25 points against Arizona in the Big 12 Tournament Championship Game.Sharp was the most outstanding player of the tournament. Kelvin Sampson gets top rebounder J'Wan Roberts (ankle) back for the NCAA Tournament. This is Sampson's best team he has had at Houston. A Final Four is almost a lock. Then we'll see if that balance transfers to win a national championship. The Cougars are 25-2 since Nov. 30. The only conference loss is by 1 to Texas Tech. Watch Sampson himself. If he wins it all at 69 is this his walk off in San Antonio.\\n\\nChip Patterson\\n\\nAuburn and Houston face absolute landmines on the way to the Final Four and that opens things up for Duke and Florida, who may be the No. 2 and No. 4 seeds in this tournament according to the selection committee but are the No. 1 and No. 2 teams on the board for the national title odds. The ACC and SEC Tournament champs each showed their versatility over the last week, and that's why I think they'll endure the path to the title game. Duke won two and a half games without star Cooper Flagg (ankle) and looked excellent against Louisville with the Blue Devils' depth on full display. Florida just beat three of the top 18 teams in the NCAA Tournament selection committee's rankings in back-to-back nights en route to cutting down nets in Nashville. Ultimately I'll take Duke over Florida in the title game but feel more confident about both teams making the Final Four than who ends up on top if they should meet on the final Monday night of the season.\\n\\nCameron Salerno\\n\\nDuke enters the NCAA Tournament feeling relieved after superstar freshman Cooper Flagg appears to have escaped a potential tournament-altering injury. The Blue Devils showed their depth and experience during the ACC Tournament without Flagg in the lineup and have a favorable draw to get back to the Final Four. Flagg can bring a championship back home to Duke and solidify himself as one of the most accomplished one-and-done players in college basketball history by winning a national title. Duke will be the last team standing in San Antonio.\\n\\nIsaac Trotter\\n\\nDuke has lost one game since Nov. 28. One. That's just so hard for me to overlook, and I like Duke's processes on both ends of the floor. The Blue Devils create a boatload of catch-and-shoot 3-pointers or shots at the rim. Duke also is elite at protecting the rim with maybe the best shot-blocker in the 2025 NBA Draft. What does this recipe remind you of? Oh, UConn. The game plans that fueled UConn can be the exact same blueprint Duke uses to win the title.\",\n",

       "  'publish_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 3, 18, 0, 0),\n",
       "  'text': 'TOKYO — The baseball-mad country of Japan greeted perhaps the brightest star it has ever produced with silence.\\n\\nWhen Shohei Ohtani stepped into the batter’s box to open Major League Baseball’s season against his fellow countryman, Shota Imanaga, the 42,365 fans inside the Tokyo Dome quieted. Such is the custom. The Chicago Cubs were technically the home team in this international showcase. But it’s the reigning World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers, unmatched in their spending and envied for their dominance in the sport, whose presence looms largest in this country.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nNo one is more influential than Ohtani. It’s Ohtani’s face that is plastered on advertisements throughout Tokyo and beyond. Ohtani whose fingerprints have been used to “paint Japan Dodger blue.” Ohtani who leads this talented generation of players, and who found himself again as the center of attention on Tuesday as the Dodgers defeated the Cubs, 4-1.\\n\\n“It’s been a while that I felt actually this nervous playing a game,” Ohtani said.\\n\\nThat represented a rare moment of introspection. The night’s history has been anticipated for the better part of a year. But Japan’s baseball community has been building toward moments like this for more than a century. Being the face of his home country’s iconic moment meant something different, even for a two-way star seemingly capable of doing anything on a baseball field.\\n\\n“I don’t think I’ve ever seen Shohei nervous,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. “One thing I did notice is how emotional he got during the Japanese national anthem. That was really something that was very telling, how emotional he was.”\\n\\nThe thousands inside the Tokyo Dome and the millions watching on television bore witness to the first-ever Opening Day matchup of Japanese-born pitchers as Imanaga delivered four no-hit innings and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who 15 months ago received the richest contract ever for a pitcher, went five innings, allowing one run while showing signs of dominance in getting the win. Seiya Suzuki hit second in the order as the Cubs’ designated hitter, an acknowledgment of his value for a franchise seeking a breakthrough.\\n\\nThe event’s history, and Ohtani’s place in it, was reflected in the feted baseball hero who made an appearance before it began. No person has ever compiled more home runs in professional baseball than Sadaharu Oh, who hit 868 over 22 seasons with the Yomiuri Giants. The 84-year-old Oh’s presence on the field during batting practice was akin to an imperial visit. Roberts, who dined with Oh this last December, greeted him with childlike joy.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“Dream come true,” Roberts said.\\n\\nHall of Famers like Ken Griffey Jr. and Cooperstown-bound CC Sabathia lined up with current players like the Dodgers’ Teoscar Hernández for photos, looking to preserve a piece of history even as it was still being written.\\n\\n“I don’t think that there was a Japanese baseball player in Japan that didn’t watch this game tonight,” Roberts said. “I’m sure that they can see themselves in this situation.”\\n\\nYet whenever Ohtani stepped up to the plate, a sea of phones and flashbulbs greeted his every move. The three-time MVP has become the face not just of the sport, but of Japanese life, the biggest star in a monoculture that adores him. At 7:10 p.m., the cameras trained on him as he grounded out against Imanaga. In the third inning, the crowd stirred, then groaned as Ohtani’s line drive found the back of second baseman Jon Berti’s glove rather than the shiny green turf.\\n\\nThe crowd roared to life in the fifth inning as Ohtani cracked a single that, at 107.4 mph, nearly struck the Dodgers’ Andy Pages on the basepaths. Instead, it shot through the right side of the infield for the Dodgers’ first hit. A batter later, Tommy Edman tied the game with a single of his own. Teoscar Hernández chopped a ground ball for a potential double play that Berti instead fired past Michael Busch at first base — Ohtani scored, becoming just the second Japanese player after Hideki Matsui to score a run in his home country in a major-league game. They roared again when Ohtani hooked a double down the right-field line in the ninth inning, coming around to score again two batters later.\\n\\nWith that, the Dodgers began their title defense with a victory despite missing two of their stars. Mookie Betts, fighting an illness severe enough that he’s shed 15 pounds, traveled back to Los Angeles to recuperate. And Freddie Freeman was a late scratch from the starting lineup due to what the team called left rib discomfort.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThose absences aside, every element of the night seemed like a fantasy for the sport, which chose these two squads for the international assignment nearly a year ago. The Dodgers have embraced Japan more than ever before, committing more than $1 billion combined to Ohtani and Yamamoto in December 2023 and adding to what they hope is a competitive and financial advantage in the market this past offseason in signing Roki Sasaki, who is set to make his major-league debut Wednesday. Their bottom lines are healthy, and their business opportunities have seemingly increased by the day.\\n\\n“I had a luncheon today with all of our sponsors,” Dodgers CEO Stan Kasten said in the hours before his team took the global stage. “It was a big luncheon. And they are all so pleased. Whenever you have a customer that’s that happy with you, it’s very gratifying.”\\n\\nThe Cubs, trying to return to contention, have leaned back into the Japanese pipeline. In the days before the series began, manager Craig Counsell suggested that the bonding experience fostered by spending a week untethered on the other side of the planet could help sow the seeds of the next great iteration of the franchise in a make-or-break season.\\n\\n“As much as anything, this is the word: kizuna,” Counsell said, “which is a Japanese word for bond…. This is the start of a journey for our team.”\\n\\nA packed crowd and a frenetic atmosphere were a great way to start.\\n\\n“It feels like a playoff environment, which is awesome,” said Cubs president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer. “Those are the butterflies that you want, that’s the energy that you want. There’s no feeling like the postseason when everyone’s hanging on every pitch. I have a feeling this is going to feel that way. It’s good for our players to feel that.”\\n\\nThe exhibition games against Japanese clubs such as the Yomiuri Giants and Hanshin Tigers provided an introduction beyond quirks like the between-innings sushi race or the army of Pikachus who manned the night’s opening ceremonies. Dodgers infielder Miguel Rojas recalled the tales of Venezuelan ballplayers Alex Ramirez and Alex Cabrera, who rose to stardom playing in Japan’s highest league, Nippon Professional Baseball. The NPB, they said, was the closest comparison to winter ball in Latin America.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“The Japanese culture and fans live baseball,” Rojas said.\\n\\nIn Japan, of course, it sounds a little different.\\n\\n“I think it’s great how it’s pitch silent while the home team is pitching,” Dodgers utilityman Kiké Hernández said. “And then it’s just like a party when they’re hitting. That’s my kind of party.”\\n\\nThis party looked more like a continued coronation, not just for the defending World Series champions, but for the game’s biggest star and a country seizing a sporting moment.\\n\\n(Photo: Philip Fong / AFP via Getty Images)',\n",

       "  'text': 'You don\\'t see this every day.\\n\\nIt\\'s rare for any observatory to directly image a planet beyond our solar system, called an exoplanet, but the powerful James Webb Space Telescope has captured four of them in the stellar system HR 8799. These large, gaseous worlds are located 130 light-years away in the Milky Way galaxy (a light-year is nearly 6 trillion miles). Importantly, viewing these worlds also revealed major parts of their composition, and how they likely formed.\\n\\n\"Our hope with this kind of research is to understand our own solar system, life, and ourselves in the comparison to other exoplanetary systems, so we can contextualize our existence,\" William Balmer, an astronomer at Johns Hopkins University who led the new research, said in a statement. \"We want to take pictures of other solar systems and see how they’re similar or different when compared to ours. From there, we can try to get a sense of how weird our solar system really is — or how normal.\"\\n\\nThe research recently published in The Astrophysical Journal.\\n\\nIt\\'s tremendously challenging to capture direct images of exoplanets — as opposed to common observational methods like watching them transit in front of their stars — because their nearby stars are profoundly luminous, engulfing the exoplanets in light. But Webb blocked out much of the star\\'s intrusive light with an instrument called a coronograph. What\\'s more, these four worlds are large, young, and hot, and orbit relatively far from their star.\\n\\n\"From there, we can try to get a sense of how weird our solar system really is — or how normal.\"\\n\\nYou can see four of these planets below. \"The closest planet to the star, HR 8799 e, orbits 1.5 billion miles from its star, which in our solar system would be located between the orbit of Saturn and Neptune,\" NASA explains. \"The furthest, HR 8799 b, orbits around 6.3 billion miles from the star, more than twice Neptune’s orbital distance.\" A star symbol covers the star HR 8799, whose light has been blocked.\\n\\nNo, they don\\'t contain the stunning detail we see on the closeby planets in our solar system.

Perrin (STScI)\\n\\nCrucially, directly viewing these planets allowed astronomers to analyze the unique light signals emanating from these worlds; these wavelengths match certain elements or molecules. Of note, the researchers detected the gases carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. These planets are extremely young, at some 30 million years old, so astronomers suspect they formed like Saturn and Jupiter, wherein they forged dense solid cores and then gravitationally pulled plentiful surrounding gases like carbon dioxide around them. (Alternatively, sometimes planets might form when they rapidly fuse together inside the rapidly spinning disk of dust and gas around a new star, meaning they\\'re largely composed of the same stuff as their star.)\\n\\nAs Balmer noted above, we need to spy what\\'s transpiring in other corners of the galaxy to better grasp how strange, or not, our solar system neighborhood truly is. Already, we know that many other solar systems contain curious super-Earths — which are bigger than Earth but smaller than Neptune — but there\\'s no such world in our system.\\n\\nThe Webb telescope captured clear \"spectral fingerprints\" of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide in the planet HR 8799 e\\'s atmosphere. Credit: NASA / ESA / CSA / STScI / J. Olmsted (STScI)\\n\\nThe Webb telescope\\'s powerful abilities\\n\\nThe Webb telescope — a scientific collaboration between NASA, ESA, and the Canadian Space Agency — is designed to peer into the deepest cosmos and reveal new insights about the early universe. It\\'s also examining intriguing planets in our galaxy, along with the planets and moons in our solar system.\\n\\nHere\\'s how Webb is achieving unparalleled feats, and may for years to come:\\n\\n- Giant mirror: Webb\\'s mirror, which captures light, is over 21 feet across. That\\'s over two-and-a-half times larger than the Hubble Space Telescope\\'s mirror, meaning Webb has six times the light-collecting area. Capturing more light allows Webb to see more distant, ancient objects. The telescope is peering at stars and galaxies that formed over 13 billion years ago, just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. \"We\\'re going to see the very first stars and galaxies that ever formed,\" Jean Creighton, an astronomer and the director of the Manfred Olson Planetarium at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, told Mashable in 2021.\\n\\n- Infrared view: Unlike Hubble, which largely views light that\\'s visible to us, Webb is primarily an infrared space telescope, meaning it views light in the infrared spectrum. This allows us to see far more of the universe. Infrared has longer wavelengths than visible light, so the light waves more efficiently slip through cosmic clouds; the light doesn\\'t as often collide with and get scattered by these densely packed particles. Ultimately, Webb\\'s infrared eyesight can penetrate places Hubble can\\'t.\\n\\n\"It lifts the veil,\" said Creighton.\\n\\n- Peering into distant exoplanets: The Webb telescope carries specialized equipment called spectrographs that will revolutionize our understanding of these far-off worlds. The instruments can decipher what molecules (such as water, carbon dioxide, and methane) exist in the atmospheres of distant exoplanets — be they gas giants or smaller rocky worlds. Webb looks at exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy. Who knows what we\\'ll find?\\n\\n\"We might learn things we never thought about,\" Mercedes López-Morales, an exoplanet researcher and astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics-Harvard & Smithsonian, previously told Mashable.',\n",

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\\n\\nCNN —\\n\\nSummary Firefly Aerospace has completed its historic Blue Ghost lunar mission, achieving 100% of objectives during two weeks on the moon.\\n\\nThe car-size robotic lander collected 120 gigabytes of data and operated for five hours after lunar nightfall.\\n\\nBlue Ghost conducted experiments including GPS signal reception, lunar dust collection and soil temperature measurements.\\n\\nFirefly declared it the first \"fully successful\" commercial moon landing, contrasting with Intuitive Machines\\' sideways landings.\\n\\nThe mission operated under NASA\\'s Commercial Lunar Payload Services program with a $101.5 million contract.\\n\\nFirefly Aerospace, the Texas-based company that conducted a pristine moon landing with its Blue Ghost spacecraft earlier this month, is declaring the historic mission over after achieving “100 percent” of its objectives. The feat marks the first “fully successful” commercial operation on the moon, the company said Monday.\\n\\nBlue Ghost, a four-legged robotic lander roughly the size of a small car, spent two weeks operating on the moon’s near-side. The landing site was close to an ancient volcanic feature called Mons Latreille, which lies just north of the equator.\\n\\nBlue Ghost basked in sunlight for the vast majority of the mission until lunar nightfall brought darkness to the landing site on Sunday. But the vehicle was able fulfill a key goal of the mission and continue operating for about five hours after sundown as batteries provided power.\\n\\nDuring operations, the lander beamed a total of about 120 gigabytes of data — equivalent to more than 24,000 songs — back to Earth. Blue Ghost’s endeavors included acquiring the farthest-ever received GPS signal, using a special vacuum to collect and sort lunar dust, and deploying a drill to measure soil temperatures.\\n\\nFirefly mission control received the final signal from Blue Ghost around 7:15 p.m. ET (6:15 p.m. CT) on Sunday, according to the company.\\n\\nThis image was captured by Firefly\\'s Blue Ghost lander during lunar sunset with the Earth visible as a crescent on the horizon. Firefly Aerospace\\n\\n“This achievement marks the longest commercial operations on the Moon to date,” Firefly said in a statement.\\n\\nThe Blue Ghost lander also delivered a farewell dispatch before switching into “monument mode,” a reference to the fact that the lander is expected to lie dormant on the moon’s surface for the foreseeable future.\\n\\n“Mission mode change detected, now in Monument Mode; Goodnight friends,” the message from the spacecraft read, according to a post shared by Firefly on the social media platform X.\\n\\n“I will hold vigil on this spot in Mare Crisium to watch humanity’s continued journey to the stars. Here, I will outlast your mightiest rivers, your tallest mountains, and perhaps even your species as we know it,” the note continued. “But it is remarkable that a species might be outlasted by its own ingenuity. Here lies Blue Ghost, a testament to the team who, with the loving support of their families and friends, built and operated this machine and its payloads.”\\n\\nBlue Ghost’s historic moon-landing mission\\n\\nOperating during lunar night is a trying task, as lunar surface temperatures can swing wildly from positive 250 degrees Fahrenheit (121 degrees Celsius) to as cold as minus 280 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 173 degrees Celsius).\\n\\nAs lunar nightfall descended, Blue Ghost was expected to capture 4K video of the lunar horizon glow. During the phenomenon, which previously had been witnessed by Apollo astronauts, moon dust particles appear to levitate around lunar sunset.\\n\\nNASA and Firefly plan to share those observations during a news conference slated for Tuesday at 2 p.m. ET (1 p.m. CT).\\n\\nSeparately, Blue Ghost witnessed an eclipse from the lunar surface last week. The event cast Earth’s shadow across the moon, briefly plunging the lander into darkness. However, the robotic explorer then observed the stunning “diamond ring effect” as the sun peeked out from beyond our planet.\\n\\nBlue Ghost captured this image of the \"diamond ring effect\" that occurs during eclipses when sunlight illuminates only the outer ring of a planetary body. Such a phenomenon is seen during total solar eclipses on Earth but here is captured as the Earth eclipses the view of the sun from the moon\\'s surface. Firefly Aerospace\\n\\nFrom Earth, that eclipse was visible as a “blood moon” that appeared to turn our closest celestial neighbor a reddish-orange tint.\\n\\nOther private sector moon landers failed\\n\\nFirefly has dubbed its mission “the first fully successful commercial Moon landing” in history. The title references Intuitive Machines, another Texas-based company, whose Odysseus lander last year became the first commercial spacecraft to soft-land on the moon. That vehicle, however, landed in a sideways orientation that presented significant communications challenges and led to an early conclusion of the mission.\\n\\nIntuitive Machines’ second lander, Athena, touched down on the moon just days after Blue Ghost but met a similar fate, lying on its side near the moon’s south pole. Both of Intuitive Machines’ landing sites were in the challenging southernmost region of the moon, which is riddled with impact craters and other hazards.\\n\\nSeveral commercial companies — including US-based Astrobotic Technology, Japan-based Ispace and Israeli company SpaceIL — previously tried and failed to soft-land vehicles on the moon.\\n\\nFor decades, such missions were considered too technologically rigorous and expensive for the private sector.\\n\\nBoth Intuitive Machines and Firefly flew their lunar landers under NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services, or CLPS, program, which aims to spur the business sector to pursue lunar exploration.\\n\\nFirefly was awarded a $101.5 million fixed-price contract for this mission.\\n\\nUnder the Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, NASA hopes to establish a fleet of spacecraft developed by the private sector that can robotically explore the lunar surface — relatively quickly and cheaply — before the agency returns astronauts to the moon later this decade.\\n\\n“Our team may look younger and less experienced than those of many nations and companies that attempted Moon landings before us, but the support we have for one another is what fuels the hard work and dedication to finding every solution that made this mission a success,” said Will Coogan, Blue Ghost’s chief engineer, in a statement.',\n",

A recent bird flu outbreak among migratory eared grebes in Utah killed between 15,000 and 25,000 birds near Great Salt Lake, state wildlife officials said in early February.\\n\\nSeabirds, which tend to roost in large numbers, are also highly impacted.\\n\\nSongbirds such as Northern cardinals, blue jays or chickadees — the kind of birds that might visit bird feeders — can also become infected and die, but their populations appear to fare better since they don’t gather closely in large groups where the virus could spread, said Michael J. Parr, president of the American Bird Conservancy.\\n\\nWhat are bird flu symptoms in wild birds?\\n\\nSymptoms vary, but may include lack of coordination, inability to fly and respiratory distress.\\n\\n“If people see a wild bird acting weird, the best thing they can do is call their local wildlife rehabilitator” and avoid handling it directly, said Dr. Dana Franzen-Klein, a veterinarian and medical director at the University of Minnesota’s Raptor Center.\\n\\nIf you must handle an infected bird, it’s best to wear gloves and a mask as a precaution.\\n\\nAdvertising\\n\\nIs it safe to have a backyard bird feeder?\\n\\nExperts say bird feeders are generally safe and aren’t a notable source of spreading bird flu.\\n\\nBut if you also keep backyard chickens, Parr of the American Bird Conservancy recommends taking the bird feeder down to prevent possible transmission to poultry. Birdfeeders and nesting boxes should also be cleaned regularly.\\n\\nThe risk of spread to people from bird feeders “is very, very low,” he said.\\n\\nHow is the bird flu outbreak affecting endangered bird species?\\n\\nIn the case of critically endangered California condors, scientists organized a vaccination program after some birds became infected. But that’s not a realistic option for most wild bird species.\\n\\nInstead, experts recommend giving wild birds the best chance by taking other steps to protect habitats and reduce various risks that species face, such as exposure to pesticides or lead ammo.\\n\\nBald eagles, which are federally protected but no longer endangered, are scavengers that will eat dead animals. “That first year, we lost a lot of eagles” likely from bald eagles eating infected ducks or bringing them to their nests, said Richards.\\n\\nAdvertising\\n\\nScientists also documented an unusually high number of eagle chicks that didn’t survive into adulthood during the first breeding season after the virus appeared in North America, likely because the chicks got the virus or sick parents weren’t able to adequately feed and care for them.\\n\\nBut over time, the number of confirmed infections in eagles nationwide has declined from 427 in 2022 to 48 last year.\\n\\nThat may mean that eagles that survived the first year now have some acquired immunity, said Franzen-Klein. This past migration season, researchers counted a record number of bald eagles migrating through northern Minnesota.\\n\\n“There are good signs of hope” that eagles in the region are rebounding, she said.\\n\\n___\\n\\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

       "  'text': 'covers health for Vox, guiding readers through the emerging opportunities and challenges in improving our health. He has reported on health policy for more than 10 years, writing for Governing magazine, Talking Points Memo, and STAT before joining Vox in 2017.\\n\\nOne of America’s worst measles outbreaks in recent years continues to spread, with 292 reported cases in western Texas and eastern New Mexico as of March 17. A nearby Oklahoma county has confirmed its first case, which officials believed to be linked to the outbreak’s epicenter in Gaines County, Texas. Two people have so far died from measles infections since the outbreak began in late January.\\n\\nThe actual number of cases is likely higher than the official count, based on reports from doctors who are treating patients as well as statistical analysis (two deaths would suggest thousands of cases, based on the measles’ mortality rate of roughly 1 in 1,000 infections). Officials fear the virus’s spread could persist into the spring and summer travel seasons, allowing the virus to reach other parts of the country; more cases and deaths could follow.\\n\\nThe outbreak has now exceeded the total number of reported measles cases in the US last year, which itself had already represented an increase from 2023. Measles vaccination rates in most US states have fallen below the 95 percent threshold scientists consider necessary to control the disease, and those rates have continued to drop. The Texas emergency appears to have begun in an insular religious community with high vaccination exemption rates; 14 percent of all children in Gaines County have exemptions.\\n\\nThe nation’s health leadership, meanwhile, is undermining the best defense against measles. While US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has paid lip service to the value of vaccines, he has also pitched alternative treatments unsupported by medical science. He’s also launching new government investigations into the long-debunked theory linking autism and vaccines — investigations seem designed to erode public trust in the measles shot’s safety at the very moment it is most needed.\\n\\nWhat’s happening right now could only be the beginning. The more the US strays from the public health playbook that helped the country to reach official measles elimination in 2000, the more outbreaks will likely occur — and the bigger they’ll be.\\n\\nWe may be entering a new era when this once-dormant virus is again an active threat to people’s health. Here’s what you can do to protect yourself and your family.\\n\\nYou really, really don’t want to get measles\\n\\nMost Americans have been lucky enough to live in a world without measles, a disease that globally still kills over 100,000 people, most of them young children. Its risks, therefore, have become largely hypothetical.\\n\\nBut for the unvaccinated, those risks are real. Measles is a formidable and extremely contagious virus. It is dangerous during the initial infection, which can lead to high fever and the signature measles rash, while some patients will go on to develop pneumonia or encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, both of which can be deadly.\\n\\nMeasles has a fatality rate of 0.1 percent, but an estimated 20 percent of cases require hospitalization. The disease is particularly threatening to kids, especially young infants, as well as pregnant women and people who are immunocompromised.\\n\\nSome vaccine skeptics, including RFK Jr., downplay the risk of measles. “It used to be, when I was a kid, that everybody got measles. And the measles gave you lifetime protection against measles infection,” he said recently on Fox News. But measles was and is not some harmless disease: Between 400 to 500 children died annually from measles in the US in the decade before a vaccine was introduced in 1963. From 1968 to 2016, there were about 550 measles deaths total in the US, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Until the recent deaths in the Texas outbreak, it had been 10 years since a single measles death had been recorded in the US.\\n\\nEven those who do survive a measles infection can face long-term health consequences, particularly for those in high-risk groups. Some of those infected in the current outbreak may be dealing with the fallout for years.\\n\\nMeasles can cause what’s known as immunity amnesia. The virus can wipe out more than half a person’s preexisting antibodies that protect them against other pathogens, which can leave them more vulnerable to other diseases for years after their infection.\\n\\nIn rare cases, measles can lead to fatal brain swelling years after the initial infection. Patients can also suffer hearing loss from ear infections experienced during their illness, while those who develop acute encephalitis can suffer permanent neurological damage.\\n\\nWhat you can do to protect yourself from measles\\n\\nVaccination remains the best defense against measles: Two doses of the MMR vaccine — given to protect against measles, mumps, and rubella — is 97 percent effective at preventing a measles infection (and therefore spread). It is perhaps the most effective vaccine we have for any disease, and any risks from the vaccine are astonishingly low compared to the dangers of measles itself.\\n\\nIn this new world where you’re more likely to see a measles outbreak in your community, people should consider taking steps to protect their health or that of their loved ones. Here’s what you can do.\\n\\nParents, if you have young children—the group most at risk from measles — talk to your pediatrician about vaccination. The usual schedule is one shot around age 1 and another shot around age 5, but there is some flexibility. The CDC already advises that infants as young as 6 months can receive one dose if they are traveling internationally, and the recommended age for the second dose ranges from 4 to 6 years old. Several leading public health experts, including former CDC director Rochelle Walensky, wrote in a recent JAMA op-ed that the recommendations should be updated to advise one shot for infants traveling in the US to areas with higher risk of exposure.\\n\\nReports of vaccinated people getting sick in Texas have at the same time raised questions about how protected vaccinated people actually are. As good as it is, 97 percent effectiveness isn’t 100 percent, and it is possible to be vaccinated and still get sick. For a small percentage of people, the vaccine simply doesn’t produce immunity. It is also possible that immunity could wane over time, but that was previously not an issue because high vaccination rates had snuffed out the virus’s spread.\\n\\nIn part because there may not be a lot of excess vaccine supply, the priority should be vaccinating those people who do not have any protection at all: those very young children and the people who weren’t vaccinated as kids. Pregnant women should not receive the vaccine, but women planning to become pregnant could talk to their doctor about a booster shot; likewise, people with immune conditions should talk with their doctor before getting an additional dose, as the vaccine’s live virus could present a risk depending on their level of immunodeficiency.\\n\\nThose in high-risk groups may want to take additional precautions, such as wearing masks, if there are reports of measles infections in their immediate area. (That doesn’t just mean the areas of the current outbreak — isolated infections have also been found in California and Maryland in people who recently traveled internationally.)\\n\\nFor other people who have already been vaccinated but are worried about transmission, it may be reasonable to consider a booster shot. But there are some important steps you should take first.\\n\\nFirst, check your vaccination records if you can find them. If you received two doses as a child, you very likely had a successful immune response; only three in 100 people don’t. If you received one dose — as was generally the case before 1989 — you’re probably still good, but it is a little more likely that you never developed immunity, according to Aaron Milstone, an infectious disease pediatrician at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\\n\\nEither way, the next step would be to talk to your doctor. (As always, with anything regarding your health.) They can administer a “titer test” that measures the measles antibodies in your body. If they’re still present — great, you should be good. If they’re not, you may want to ask your doctor about getting an additional measles shot.\\n\\nThe risks should be kept in context: If you’re not near a confirmed measles case, your personal risk remains negligible. If you’re vaccinated and have antibodies, you are very likely protected from the virus regardless.\\n\\nBut they can not be ignored either. Milstone said he and his fellow infectious disease doctors could not believe it when they heard the news in February of a child’s death from measles in the United States of America.',\n",

Previously, the FDA recalled Wild Coast’s 16 oz. and 24 oz. frozen Boneless Free Range Chicken Formula raw pet food. Now, Savage Cat Food’s Large Chicken Boxes and Small Chicken Boxes have been recalled.\\n\\nFeeding your pet food that has been contaminated with bird flu is one of the major ways pets get sick with the disease.\\n\\n\\n\\nHere's everything you need to know about the recall.\\n\\nWhich products are being recalled?\\n\\nSavage Cat Food has sold these products in California, Colorado, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington. The recall applies to both their Large Chicken Boxes (84 oz) and their Small Chicken Boxes (21 oz).\\n\\nThe affected products have a lot code/best by date of 11152026 and were distributed in November 2024. You can find this code stamped on the bottom of each individual plastic packet contained in the box.\\n\\nCourtesy of FDA\\n\\nTwo cats who have eaten this food have gotten sick with bird flu, according to the FDA. Although further testing to confirm the presence of bird flu contamination in the food is ongoing, the product is being recalled for safety.\\n\\nIf you have the recalled product, “immediately return it to their retailer for proper destruction and a full refund,” the FDA urges. Do not feed it to your pet or give the food away.\\n\\nWhat are signs of bird flu in cats?\\n\\nIf your pet ate the recalled cat food, be on the lookout for symptoms of bird flu. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, these symptoms include:\\n\\nFever\\n\\nLethargy\\n\\nLow appetite\\n\\nReddened or inflamed eyes\\n\\nDischarge from the eyes and nose\\n\\nDifficulty breathing\\n\\nNeurological signs like tremors, stiff body movements, seizure, lack of coordination or blindness\\n\\nIf your pet is displaying any of these symptoms, contact your vet right away.\\n\\nThe Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports that only 70 people have been confirmed to have bird flu, but it’s still important to be cautious. Humans can also get bird flu by handling contaminated pet food and then touching the eyes, nose or mouth. If you believe you've been exposed to bird flu, and you're experiencing eye redness and irritation (conjunctivitis) or any flu-like symptoms, contact your doctor as soon as possible.\\n\\nYou Might Also Like\",\n",

       "  'text': 'This year the world should have been “talking about the virtual elimination of HIV” in the near future. “Within five years,” says Prof Sharon Lewin, a leading researcher in the field. “Now that’s all very uncertain.”\\n\\nScientific advances had allowed doctors and campaigners to feel optimistic that the end of HIV as a public health threat was just around the corner.\\n\\nThen came the Trump administration’s abrupt cuts to US aid funding. Now the picture is one of a return to the drugs rationing of decades ago, and of rising infections and deaths.\\n\\nBut experts are also talking about building a new approach that would make health services, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa, less vulnerable to the whims of a foreign power.\\n\\nThe US has cancelled 83% of its foreign aid contracts and dismantled USAid, the agency responsible for coordinating most of them.\\n\\nMany fell under the President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) programme, which has been the backbone of global efforts to tackle HIV and Aids, investing more than $110bn (£85bn) since it was founded in 2003 and credited with saving 26 million lives and preventing millions more new infections. In some African countries it covered almost all HIV spending.\\n\\nView image in fullscreen A poster advertising free HIV/Aids drugs at a public health network in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. USAid funding provided much of the funding in some African countries. Photograph: /AFP/Getty\\n\\nThere is a risk, says Lewin, director of Melbourne University’s Institute for Infection and Immunity and past president of the International Aids Society, of “dramatic increases in infections, dramatic increases in death and a real loss of decades of advances”.\\n\\nThere is no official public list of which contracts have been cancelled, and which remain. It appears that virtually no HIV-prevention programmes funded by the US are still in operation, save a handful principally providing drugs to stop pregnant women passing on the infection to their babies. Countries report disruption to the most basic measures, such as condom distribution.\\n\\nTimeline Eight key dates in the fight against Aids and HIV Show 1981 . The first reports of a mysterious, deadly illness affecting gay men in the US appear in scientific journals. 1983 Scientists at the Pasteur Institute in Paris report the discovery of a virus that could be the cause of Aids – now known as HIV. 1987 The first antiretroviral (ARV) drug to fight HIV and Aids is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The 1990s will see huge advances in treatment that see deaths plummet for those who can afford the drugs. 2001 Generic pharmaceutical companies offer to produce cheaper forms of ARVs for developing countries. There are over 20 million people living with HIV in Africa but virtually no access to the drugs. 2003 The President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) is announced by George W Bush to address HIV and Aids in hard-hit countries worldwide. It will eventually invest over $110bn (£84bn) and prevent millions of infections and deaths. 2007 The first cure: doctors announce that Timothy Ray Brown of San Francisco is free of HIV after undergoing a bone marrow transplant to treat leukaemia. 2015 The UN sets a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) to end Aids as a public health threat by 2030. 2025 Sweeping cuts to US aid funding leave HIV patients worldwide facing a dangerously uncertain future.

Doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers have been laid off, while worried patients are hoarding drugs or stretching supplies, according to UNAids surveillance. UNAids itself has lost more than half of its funding.\\n\\nEven programmes that have survived the cull have faced turmoil since February, with instructions to stop work rescinded but with no certainty that funding will continue.\\n\\nView image in fullscreen People wait for HIV tests at an MSF clinic in South Africa’s KwaZulu-Natal province. The country could face 500,000 deaths over the next 10 years after US funding cuts.

Since the epidemic began, a total of 42.3 million people have died. 1.3 million The number of new infections in 2023, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. Women and girls accounted for 44% of these. 39.9 million The number of people around the world living with HIV. Of these, 30.7 million are accessing antiretroviral therapy. 51% The percentage by which the death rate has fallen in just over a decade.

New results from the manufacturer Gilead suggest that a tweak to the formula and how it is given could see its protective effects last even longer.\\n\\nNevertheless, Lewin says, the mood at the meeting, packed with many of the world’s leading HIV specialists, was “dire”.\\n\\nAs well as programme cancellations, there are “huge concerns around science and what’s going to happen to the [US] National Institutes of Health, [whose] funding of science has been so significant on every level”, she says.\\n\\nSome scientists in receipt of US funding have been told to remove their names from DEI-linked research, she says, even though DEI is fundamental to the HIV response.\\n\\nView image in fullscreen A nurse in Nairobi dispensing antiretroviral drugs used to treat children with HIV, whose parents died of the disease. Worried patients are now stockpiling medication. Photograph: Reuters\\n\\n“I don’t mean that in a sort of touchy-feely way, I mean that’s what we need to do: you need to actually get those treatments to these diverse communities.”\\n\\nIn 2022, 55% of all new HIV infections were within “key populations”, such as gay men, other men who have sex with men, sex workers, transgender people, prisoners and people who inject drugs.\\n\\nProf Linda-Gail Bekker, of South Africa’s Desmond Tutu Health Foundation, has seen US funding for three trials of potential HIV vaccines involving eight countries cancelled and only reinstated after an appeal to the US supreme court.\\n\\n“We’re running around like chickens without heads to at least get one going, because the vaccines are sitting in the fridge and will expire,” she says.\\n\\nShe led the lenacapavir trial that showed it offered 100% protection to young women in sub-Saharan Africa, but now worries about HIV/Aids prevention “falling off the radar completely”.\\n\\nThe global community had been making headway towards the United Nations’ goal of ending Aids by 2030, she says, with a five-year plan to use “amazing new innovative tools and scale them up”, which would have led to “less dependence on foreign aid and more self-reliance” as new infections fell and attention shifted to maintaining treatment for people with HIV.\\n\\n“All of that is hugely at risk now because, without these funds, our governments will have to step up but they will concentrate on treatment,” she says. “We know they will do that, because that is what we did for the first 30 years.”\\n\\nEfforts to control Aids were entering “the last mile”, which was always likely to be more expensive, she says. “The people who were happy to come into health facilities, they would have come into health facilities.”\\n\\nIt would be difficult to rely on government funding to reach the remaining groups, she says, not only because of fewer resources but also because in some countries it means targeting groups whose existence is illegal and unrecognised, such as sex workers or sexual minorities, and young girls may be reluctant to use government clinics if they are not supposed to be sexually active.\\n\\n“I feel like the odds are very stacked against us,” says Bekker, adding: “We’re obviously going to have to re-programme ourselves [and] formulate a different plan.”\\n\\nPepfar had pledged funding to the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, to deploy 10m doses of lenacapavir in low-income countries. While the Global Fund has promised to maintain its commitment, it might receive fewer than the planned number of doses, Bekker fears.\\n\\n“Six months ago, I was saying the best thing we can do with lenacapavir is offer it to everybody in a choice environment. [Now] I think we’re gonna have to say who needs [injectable] prep,” she says, “and the rest have to do the best they can.\\n\\n“How do we make that decision? And what does that look like? It is back to sort of rationing.\\n\\n“When we started ARVs [antiretroviral drugs] way back in 2000,” Bekker recalls, “you would go, ‘you get treatment; you don’t, you don’t, you don’t’.\\n\\n“It feels terrible … but you have to get over that. You have to say it will be infection-saving for some people. And we’ve got to make it count.”\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Volunteers for an HIV vaccine trial in Bukakata, Uganda. Experts fear that the huge progress made in finding a prophylactic vaccine will be undone due to the cuts. Photograph: Getty\\n\\nFor Beatriz Grinsztejn, president of the International Aids Society, the disruption is critical and threatens many vulnerable people. But, she adds, it could present “an important opportunity for ownership – otherwise we are always left in the hands of others”.\\n\\nShe worries about the impact of cuts to funding on younger scientists, with their potential loss from the research field “a major threat for the next generation”. But, she adds, the HIV community is “powerful and very resilient”.\\n\\nThere have already been calls for new ways of doing things. It is “time for African leadership”, members of the African-led HIV Control Working Group write in the Lancet Global Health. There are now plans for Nigeria to produce HIV drugs and tests domestically.\\n\\nChristine Stegling, deputy director of UNAids, says it began “a concerted effort” last year to develop plans with countries about how their HIV programmes could become more sustainable domestically “but with a longer timeframe … now we are trying to do some kind of fast-tracking”.\\n\\nGovernments are determined, she says, but it will require fiscal changes either in taxation or by restructuring debt.\\n\\nThe goal of ending Aids by 2030 is still achievable, Stegling believes. “I think we have a very short window of opportunity now, in the next two, three months, to continue telling people that we can do it.\\n\\n“I keep on reminding people, ‘look, we need to get back to that same energy that we had when people were telling us treatment can’t be available in the global south, right?’ And we didn’t accept it. We made it happen.\\n\\n“We have national governments now who are also very adamant, because they can see what can happen, and they want to make it happen for their own populations.”',\n",
