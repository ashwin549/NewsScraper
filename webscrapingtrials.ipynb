       "  'text': \"The threat of higher iPhone prices caused some Americans to rush to Apple stores to buy new phones.\\n\\nAfter more than a week of ratcheting up tariffs on products imported from China, the Trump administration issued a rule late Friday that spared smartphones, computers, semiconductors and other electronics from some of the fees, in a significant break for tech companies like Apple and Dell and the prices of iPhones and other consumer electronics.\\n\\nA message posted late Friday by U.S. Customs and Border Protection included a long list of products that would not face the reciprocal tariffs President Trump imposed in recent days on Chinese goods as part of a worsening trade war. The exclusions would also apply to modems, routers, flash drives and other technology goods, which are largely not made in the United States.\\n\\nThe exemptions are not a full reprieve. Other tariffs will still apply to electronics and smartphones. The Trump administration had applied a tariff of 20 percent on Chinese goods earlier this year for what the administration said was the country’s role in the fentanyl trade. And the administration could still end up increasing tariffs for semiconductors, a vital component of smartphones and other electronics.\\n\\nThe moves were the first major exemptions for Chinese goods, which would have wide-ranging implications for the U.S. economy if they persist. Tech giants such as Apple and Nvidia would largely sidestep punitive taxes that could slash their profits. Consumers — some of whom rushed to buy iPhones this past week — would avoid major potential price increases on smartphones, computers and other gadgets. And the exemptions could dampen additional inflation and calm the turmoil that many economists feared might lead to a recession.\\n\\nThe tariff relief was also the latest flip-flop in Mr. Trump’s effort to rewrite global trade in a bid to boost U.S. manufacturing. The factories that churn out iPhones, laptops and other electronics are deeply entrenched in Asia — especially in China — and are unlikely to move without a galvanizing force like the steep taxes that the Trump administration had proposed.\\n\\n“It’s difficult to know if there’s a realization within the administration that reworking the American economy is a gargantuan effort,” said Matthew Slaughter, the dean of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.\\n\\nThe electronics exemptions apply to all countries, not just China.\\n\\nStill, any relief for the electronics industry may be short-lived, since the Trump administration is preparing another national security-related trade investigation into semiconductors. That will also apply to some downstream products like electronics, since many semiconductors come into the United States inside other devices, a person familiar with the matter said. These investigations have previously resulted in additional tariffs.\\n\\nKaroline Leavitt, the White House spokeswoman, said in a statement on Saturday that Mr. Trump was still committed to seeing more of these products and components made domestically. “President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies” and that at his direction, tech companies “are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible,” she said.\\n\\nA senior administration official, speaking on background because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said that Friday’s exemptions were aimed at maintaining America’s supply of semiconductors, a foundational technology used in smartphones, cars, toasters and dozens of other products. Many cutting-edge semiconductors are manufactured overseas, such as in Taiwan.\\n\\nPaul Ashworth, the chief North America economist for Capital Economics, said the move “represents a partial de-escalation of President Trump’s trade war with China.”\\n\\nHe said the 20 product types that were exempted on Friday account for nearly a quarter of U.S. imports from China. Other countries in Asia would be even bigger winners, he said. Should the tariffs on those countries kick in again, the exemption would cover 64 percent of U.S. imports from Taiwan, 44 percent of imports from Malaysia and nearly a third of imports from both Vietnam and Thailand, he said.\\n\\nThe changes punctuated a wild week in which Mr. Trump backtracked from many tariffs he introduced on April 2, which he had called “liberation day.” His so-called reciprocal tariffs had introduced taxes that would reach up to 40 percent on products imported from some nations. After the stock and bond markets plunged, Mr. Trump reversed course and said he would pause levies for 90 days.\\n\\nChina was the one exception to Mr. Trump's relief because Beijing chose to retaliate against U.S. tariffs with levies of its own. Instead of pausing tariffs on Chinese imports, Mr. Trump increased them to 145 percent and showed no willingness to spare any companies from those fees. In return, China on Friday said it was raising its tariffs on American goods to 125 percent.\\n\\nThat sent shares of many technology companies into free fall. Over four days of trading, the valuation of Apple, which makes about 80 percent of its iPhones in China, fell by $773 billion.\\n\\nFor now, Mr. Trump’s moderation is a major relief for a tech industry that has spent months cozying up to the president. Meta, Amazon and several tech leaders donated millions to President Trump’s inauguration, stood behind him as he was sworn into office in January and promised to invest billions of dollars in the United States to support him.\\n\\nTim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, has been at the forefront of the industry’s courtship of Mr. Trump. He donated $1 million to Mr. Trump’s inauguration and later visited the White House to pledge that Apple would spend $500 billion in the United States over the next four years.\\n\\nThe strategy repeated Mr. Cook’s tactics during Mr. Trump’s first term. To head off requests that Apple begin manufacturing its products in the United States rather than China, Mr. Cook cultivated a personal relationship with the president that helped Apple win exemptions on tariffs for its iPhones, smartwatches and laptops.\\n\\nIt had been unclear if Mr. Cook could obtain a similar break this time, and the tariffs Mr. Trump proposed were more severe. As the Trump administration increased its taxes on Chinese goods, Wall Street analysts said Apple might have to increase the price of its iPhones from $1,000 to more than $1,600.\\n\\nThe threat of higher iPhone prices caused some Americans to rush to Apple stores to buy new phones. Others raced to buy computers and tablets that were made in China.\\n\\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nApple’s iPhone quickly became a symbol of the tit-for-tat over tariffs with China. On Sunday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick appeared on CBS’s “Face the Nation” and said the tariffs would result in an “army of millions and millions of people screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones” in the United States. Ms. Leavitt said later in the week that Mr. Trump believed that the United States had the resources to make iPhones for Apple.\\n\\n“Apple has invested $500 billion here in the United States,” she said. “So if Apple didn’t think the United States could do it, they probably wouldn’t have put up that big chunk of change.”\\n\\nApple has faced questions about moving some iPhone manufacturing to the United States for more than a decade. In 2011, President Obama asked Steve Jobs, Apple’s co-founder, what it would take to make the company’s best-selling product in the United States rather than China. In 2016, Mr. Trump also pressured Apple to change its position.\\n\\nMr. Cook has remained steadfast in his commitment to China and has said the United States doesn’t have enough skilled manufacturing workers to compete with China.\\n\\n“In the U.S., you could have a meeting of tooling engineers, and I’m not sure we could fill the room,” he said at a conference in late 2017. “In China, you could fill multiple football fields.”\\n\\nAdditional tariffs on semiconductors and other electronics could come in the next few weeks or months. The administration has signaled it is considering such tariffs under a legal statute known as Section 232, alongside other tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals.\\n\\nThe president has already used the statute to put a 25 percent tariff on imported steel, aluminum and automobiles, and is weighing similar steps for imported lumber and copper. All of those sectors were given exemptions from the so-called reciprocal tariffs that the president announced on April 2.\\n\\nSpeaking to reporters the next day, the president said that other tariffs on chips would be “starting very soon,” adding that the administration was also looking at tariffs on pharmaceuticals. “We’ll be announcing that sometime in the near future,” he said. “It’s under review right now.”\\n\\nThe other tariffs that the Trump administration has applied through Section 232 investigations have been set at 25 percent — much lower than the 145 percent tariff currently in place for many products from China.\\n\\nMaggie Haberman contributed reporting.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Federal judge orders USDA to unfreeze funds to Maine\\n\\ntoggle caption Robert F. Bukaty/AP\\n\\nA federal judge ordered the Trump administration to unfreeze federal funding that was allocated to Maine from the U.S. Department of Agriculture — funds that had been withheld following President Trump\\'s clash with Maine Gov. Janet Mills over the issue of transgender athletes.\\n\\nU.S. District Court Judge John Woodcock granted Maine\\'s request for a temporary restraining order on Friday. The USDA is just one of the agencies where federal funding for Maine has been threatened. The agency did not immediately respond to request for a comment.\\n\\nThe feud between Trump and the state of Maine began after the president issued an executive order in early February barring transgender student athletes from playing on girls\\' sports teams. The order also calls for the federal government \"to rescind all funds from educational programs that deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities.\"\\n\\nSponsor Message\\n\\nIn response, the Maine Principals\\' Association, which governs school sports in the state, said it will continue to allow trans girls to compete, asserting that federal action is at odds with state law. Then, on Feb. 21, during a governors\\' event at the White House, Trump called out Mills for resisting his executive order.\\n\\n\"You better do it, because you\\'re not going to get any federal funding at all if you don\\'t,\" Trump told Mills.\\n\\nTo which Mills replied, \"See you in court.\"\\n\\nSince the confrontation, Trump has demanded an apology from the Maine governor. \"We need a full throated apology from the Governor herself, and a statement that she will never make such an unlawful challenge to the Federal Government again, before this case can be settled,\" he wrote on social media.\\n\\nFollowing the fallout, the Trump administration has also initiated multiple investigations into Maine, citing concerns over Title IX, which prohibits discrimination in education based on sex, Maine Public Radio reported. That includes the Education Department and the Department of Health and Human Services.\\n\\nThe USDA got involved earlier this month. In a letter on April 2, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins told Mills that USDA funding for certain administrative and technological functions in schools will be paused in response to the governor\\'s \"defiance of federal law.\"\\n\\nSponsor Message\\n\\nIt was unclear how much aid would be affected but Rollins threatened that other areas of research and education-related funding will be reviewed. In response, the state of Maine filed a complaint on Monday, arguing that the USDA did not follow the mandatory statutory and regulatory steps before it can terminate federal funds.\\n\\nIn the suit, Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey urged the court to reinstate federal funds, arguing that it was aid used to feed schoolchildren in Maine.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Donald Trump has authorized the military to take control of land at the US-Mexico border as part of the president’s broader efforts to crack down on undocumented immigration.\\n\\nThe authorization came late on Friday in a memorandum from Trump to interior secretary Doug Burgum, defense secretary Pete Hegseth, homeland security secretary Kristi Noem and agricultural secretary Brooke Rollins, outlining new policies concerning military involvement at the US’s southern border.\\n\\nThe memorandum, entitled “Military Mission for Sealing the Southern Border of the United States and Repelling Invasions”, allows the US’s armed forces to “take a more direct role” when it comes to securing the boundary in question.\\n\\n“Our southern border is under attack from a variety of threats,” the order claimed. “The complexity of the current situation requires that our military take a more direct role in securing our southern border than in the recent past.”\\n\\nThe memorandum added that the Department of Defense should be given jurisdiction to federal lands, including the Roosevelt Reservation, a 60ft-wide strip that stretches over California, Arizona and New Mexico. Doing that would give troops stationed there the legal right to detain immigrants accused of trespassing on what in effect is an elongated base – and unauthorized immigrants would be held in custody until they could be turned over to immigration agents.\\n\\nMilitary activities that could be carried out on federal land include “border-barrier construction and emplacement of detection and monitoring equipment”, according to the memorandum.\\n\\nAfter 45 days, the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, will assess the “initial phase” of the order. But at any time, Hegseth could extend the amount of federal land included in the memorandum.\\n\\nThe ordered military takeover excludes Native American reservations, according to the memorandum.\\n\\nFriday’s order is the latest step from Trump in his administration’s ongoing focus on immigration enforcement, which has involved declaring a national emergency on the southern border.\\n\\nOn Thursday, a US federal judge ruled that the Trump administration was allowed to require people who are in the country but not citizens to register with the federal government, a requirement that advocates say hasn’t been universally implemented since it was enacted as a law in the 1940s.\\n\\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

       "  'text': 'When the first two rounds of 10% tariffs hit, Zou Guoqing, a Chinese exporter, groaned but didn’t find the barriers insurmountable. He gave up some of his profits and offered his client, a snow-bike factory in Nebraska, price cuts ranging from 5% to 10%. It seemed to work: The factory agreed to a new order of molds and parts.\\n\\nBut when President Donald Trump announced an additional 34% universal tariff on Chinese goods on April 2, Zou, who’s been exporting to the U.S. for more than a decade, was incredulous.\\n\\n“There’s not a thread of feasibility,” said Zou, who does business in the eastern Chinese city of Ningbo. “It looks like I would have no choice but give up trading with the U.S.”\\n\\nThen came 50% more from Trump, followed by another hike — pushing the universal tariff on Chinese goods to the sky-high 145%, and Zou said he now could only hope that the two leaders can communicate. “We are pausing the shipments,” he said, “until the leaders talk.”\\n\\nThe 145% tariff from the United States and the retaliatory 125% tariff from China are putting businesses doing trade between the U.S. and China on edge. They’re fretting not only about their next orders, but also the viability of their business if there’s no quick relief. Experts are worried the decades-long trade ties that have underpinned the relationship between the world’s two largest economies could be unraveling.\\n\\nTrade ties are tested\\n\\nIf the high tariff is sustained for the next six months or longer, “that would actually lead to a real effective decoupling between the American and Chinese economies,” said Chen Zhiwu, professor of finance at Hong Kong University Business School.\\n\\nJosh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomics Center, said the sky-high tariff, if kept in place, amounts to “almost a trade embargo,” making it impossible for China to export low-value items such as apparel to the U.S. It also would force U.S. businesses to source elsewhere, away from China, if there should be alternatives, he said.\\n\\nIn a turn, the Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs, which means they won’t be subject to the 145% tariffs levied on China. The exemption seemed to reflect Trump’s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon.\\n\\nIn China, the central tariff office flat-out declared there was “no possibility for market acceptance” of U.S. goods exported to China” at the current tariff level.\\n\\n“Everyone’s pretty worried,” said Hu Jianlong, founder of Brands Factory, a consultancy that works with Chinese companies trying to break into overseas markets. “At this point in time, there’s no good way forward. This situation has not resolved ... there’s no final number. And so everyone’s still waiting to see how this will develop.”\\n\\nThe high-stakes tariff war has come more than 20 years after China — with the help of the United States — joined the World Trade Organization and began to see its economy soar on luring foreign investments and exporting to the U.S. and other Western markets. By last year, China-U.S. trade was $582 billion, but tensions have flared over China’s widening trade imbalance with the U.S. That led to the first tariff skirmish during the first Trump term.\\n\\nThe trade deficit has since narrowed but stayed stubbornly high, at a time when the U.S. and other Western markets have also grown concerned about another onslaught of Chinese products such as electric vehicles.\\n\\nDecouple or ‘de-risk’?\\n\\nDuring his four-year term, former President Joe Biden stressed that the U.S. was not trying to decouple from China but to “de-risk.” He took the “small-yard, high-fence” approach, under which his administration put up barriers in targeted sectors such as advanced chips, artificial intelligence and quantum computing that have national security implications.\\n\\nNow, Trump is declaring universal tariffs on Chinese goods but has said he’s also willing to talk with Beijing. It remains unclear what his goals might be.\\n\\n“What are they looking for in those negotiations? How much is it possible to reduce these tariffs? What are the other demands apart from China removing its retaliatory tariffs that the United States wants to put forward. We don’t know what that would be,” said Greta Peisch, who served as the general counsel for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in 2021-2024.\\n\\nThe message from China’s leadership is loud and clear. It will talk only when the U.S. stops “maximum pressure and capricious and destructive behavior,” said Lin Jian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson.\\n\\nLi Cheng, professor of political science at the University of Hong Kong, said the Chinese leadership is upset over being singled out by Trump when the U.S. president paused reciprocal tariffs for 90 days for all other countries. Beijing wants to make sure that “Donald Trump not state one thing in the morning and say other things in the evening,” Li said, and that Trump’s policies on China are not hijacked by his anti-China, hawkish advisers.\\n\\nWith no leadership-level negotiations in the immediate future, businesses are exploring their options.\\n\\nLisa Li, who works in sales for an athletic wear manufacturer in the northern Chinese province of Hebei, said her business was negotiating with clients over whether they could split the increased costs. It’s too early to say if her company is to give up on the U.S. market, she said, but it will “definitely expand other avenues for sales,” such as in Australia or Europe.\\n\\nDiffering views, but optimism is sagging\\n\\nIn the eastern Chinese city of Wenzhou, a manufacturing hub, a holiday lights maker was less optimistic. Bo, who shared only his surname out of concern for retaliation, said he could “only give up” if the tariff hikes were here to stay because other markets might not work.\\n\\n“In the past few years, the European market has been in a slump,” Bo said. “So we had wanted to try and develop our business in the United States.”\\n\\nIn Hong Kong, Danny Lau, who runs an aluminum-coating factory in the nearby southern Chinese city of Dongguan, said one of his U.S clients would keep buying from him for an ongoing project but was unsure about the next project. Another client told Lau that the chances are slim to strike a deal when tariffs are so high. Lau has been exploring other markets, but he says it’s not easy because some may find his high-quality products too expensive.\\n\\nAt a port in the Chinese city of Shanghai, ships heading to the U.S. had almost vanished by Thursday, the day after Trump’s tariff on China took effect, according to a report by the financial news site Caixin. Major shipping lines were drastically cutting back on trans-Pacific routes, the report said.\\n\\nFor the longer term, the tariff war is likely to prompt Chinese businesses to diversify their supply chains and move part of their manufacturing capacity outside of China, and even to the United States, said Hu, the consultant.\\n\\nSome might follow in the footsteps of the Tianjin steelmaking business, which gave up trading with the U.S. after both Trump and Biden raised tariffs on Chinese steel. “The best plan is to not come into contact,” said David Yu, who works in the company’s foreign sales department.\\n\\nHowever, not everyone is ready to give up on the U.S. market. Zou, the exporter in Ningbo, describes the U.S. market as “reliable and without finicky demands.”\\n\\n“It’s the best market on Earth,” he said. “I am waiting for the rainbow after the storm.”\\n\\n___\\n\\nWu reported from Bangkok and Tang from Washington.

       "  'text': 'As the Trump administration aggressively pushes to deport more immigrants during the president’s first year back in office, one aspirational number keeps coming up in private conversations, according to four current and former federal officials with direct knowledge of the plans: 1 million. Deporting 1 million immigrants in one year would ostensibly surpass previous statistics, as the highest number thus far was more than 400,000 a year when Barack Obama was president. But officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the internal goal, said Trump officials aren’t revealing how they are counting the numbers. Analysts say the available statistics make that target appear unrealistic, if not impossible, given funding, staffing levels and the fact that most immigrants have the right to a court hearing before being removed from the country.\\n\\nWhite House adviser Stephen Miller has been strategizing with officials from the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies on an almost daily basis to meet that goal, two of the current and former officials said. One strategy to quickly increase numbers, officials have said, is to find ways to deport some of the 1.4 million immigrants who have final deportation orders but cannot be deported because their home countries won’t take them back.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe administration is negotiating with as many as 30 countries to take deportees who are not their citizens, two officials said. In a recent court filing, the administration said it hopes to send “thousands” of immigrants to these destinations, known as third countries.\\n\\nThough administrations have tried to deport people to third countries for years, this would be the most ambitious effort yet as Trump tries to carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in U.S. history. Officials have already begun deporting people to countries where they are not citizens, including Mexico, Costa Rica and Panama. At least one immigrant was sent to Rwanda this month, though that was after extensive negotiations between his lawyers and the Biden administration.\\n\\nWhite House spokesman Kush Desai did not respond to questions about the government’s goal, but he said in an email that the Trump administration had a mandate from voters to repair the Biden administration’s handling of border security and immigration enforcement.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“The entire Trump administration is aligned on delivering on this mandate, not on arbitrary goals, with a full-of-government approach to ensure the efficient mass deportation of terrorist and criminal illegal aliens,” he said.\\n\\nTrump said on the campaign trail that he wanted to deport “millions” of immigrants, and Vice President JD Vance said last year that they could start with 1 million. But their own numbers show that is not so simple. Most of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States are entitled to an immigration court hearing before they can be deported, including criminals, and with the current backlogs, those can take months or years to resolve.\\n\\nTrump officials have made a spectacle of sending hundreds of detainees to a mega-prison in El Salvador and the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, but those are a tiny fraction of those in the country illegally. Officials remain stymied by financial and legal roadblocks, and near-constant criticism from the White House has deflated morale among immigration officers who are working at full tilt but increasingly skeptical they can meet the lofty goals, according to three former officials.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“They say it jokingly: ‘We’ve got to get a million removals,’” one former federal official said of the officers carrying out the White House’s directives. “That’s their goal.”\\n\\nAnd the 1.4 million people with outstanding removal orders can be difficult to find, despite a multiagency blitz that has enlisted the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and other agencies to help immigration officers detain and deport immigrants.\\n\\nTrump officials have called on Congress to pass a major budget bill to expand immigration enforcement. Even if Congress passes a bill, officials must then hire more officers, sign detention contracts and manage charter flights.\\n\\n“That is not just a switch you can turn on,” said Doris Meissner, a former immigration commissioner and senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank in Washington. “The deportation process is time-consuming.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTracking the official deportation numbers is difficult because the Trump administration has stopped publishing the Office of Homeland Security Statistics’ detailed monthly accounting of immigration enforcement activities. The independent, congressionally funded office has not published an enforcement report since before Trump took office.\\n\\nInstead, the available statistics are from political appointees who don’t provide detailed breakdowns.\\n\\nAs of late March, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, officers had deported more than 100,000 immigrants, though she later clarified that those numbers were a mix of Immigration and Customs Enforcement immigration arrests in the U.S. interior and from Customs and Border Protection. CBP arrests historically have included people denied entry at U.S. airports and land and sea borders. Since then, she said, deportations have ticked up another 17,000.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“This is just the beginning,” McLaughlin said in a statement. “These deportations don’t even include the number of illegal aliens who have self-deported.”\\n\\nOne major reason the Trump administration is unlikely to hit 1 million deportations is that illegal border crossings have plunged, and they have traditionally made up most removals. After Trump sent hundreds of troops to the border, illegal crossings plunged to little more than 7,000 in March, the lowest in decades.\\n\\nMeissner, of the Migration Policy Institute, said a preliminary analysis of the available data shows that arrests in the interior of the U.S. are up sharply, but deportations are not keeping pace.\\n\\nICE appears on track to arrest nearly 240,000 immigrants this fiscal year, more than double the year before, she said.\\n\\nBut Meissner said the agency, at the current pace, would deport about 212,000 people, fewer than the 271,484 deportations last fiscal year — most of whom were arrested after crossing the southern border illegally.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAnalysts say arrests have clearly increased and detention centers are nearly full — with more than 47,000 being held in late March. But removal flights are up more modestly, from about 100 in January to 134 in March, which is about 15 percent higher than the prior six-month average.\\n\\n“It would be just a massive, massive increase” to reach 1 million removals, said Tom Cartwright, an immigration advocate who tracks deportation flights. “If you’re going to do a million … where are those people going to come from?”\\n\\n“I don’t know where those numbers are,” Cartwright said. “I can’t see it.”\\n\\nFinding a way to send immigrants to third countries could be one way to quickly increase numbers.\\n\\nBut ICE’s hasty approach has worried advocates and some federal judges, especially after immigration officers admitted to mistakenly deporting a Salvadoran man to a mega-prison in that country in March despite a court order forbidding it because he had received death threats from gangs there.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFederal judges in Texas and New York have blocked administration efforts to use a wartime powers act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members without a hearing.\\n\\nA federal judge in Boston also issued a temporary order last month barring officials from deporting immigrants under regular immigration laws to a country where they are not citizens without first giving them a “meaningful opportunity” to seek humanitarian protection in the U.S.\\n\\nAfter the judge’s ruling in Boston, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem issued a memo to the heads of the three major immigration agencies saying that before deporting someone to a third country, officers must check to see if they have “diplomatic assurances” that immigrants “will not be persecuted or tortured” there.\\n\\nIf the U.S. doesn’t have assurances, officers must inform the immigrant that they will be removed to that country and give them a chance to challenge it. Someone who expresses fear of being deported to that country will be referred to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, an agency within DHS, for a screening.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThat screening will generally take place within 24 hours and may be done remotely, Noem wrote.\\n\\nLawyers for immigrants say 24 hours is a woefully inadequate amount of time to challenge such removals.\\n\\nNoem said in the guidance that immigrants must prove that it is more likely than not that they will be tortured if removed. If they cannot prove that, they will be removed. If they succeed, they could be referred to immigration court or ICE. Or, she wrote, ICE may choose another country for removal.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Why did the government take control of British Steel?\\n\\n4 hours ago Share Save Jennifer Meierhans Business reporter Sean Seddon & Maia Davies BBC News Share Save\\n\\nGetty Images\\n\\nThe UK government has taken control of British Steel\\'s plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, after it was put at risk of imminent closure. MPs were called back to Parliament on Saturday from their Easter break to pass an emergency law that handed control of the Chinese-owned site to the government, in order to keep its two blast furnaces operating.\\n\\nWhat is British Steel and how many people work there?\\n\\nBritish Steel\\'s plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, employs 2,700 people, about three-quarters of the company\\'s entire workforce. It is the last plant in the UK capable of producing virgin steel, which is used in major construction projects like new buildings and railways. Two huge blast furnaces are used to produce the steel, which has fewer imperfections than the recycled steel made elsewhere in the country. Were the plant to cease producing virgin steel, the UK would become the only member of the G7 group of leading economies without the ability to make it - a prospect the government views as a risk to the country\\'s long-term economic security.\\n\\nWho owns British Steel and has it been nationalised?\\n\\nThe company was founded in 2016 when Tata Steel sold its loss-making long products division in Scunthorpe to private investment firm Greybull Capital for a token £1. The new owners renamed the business British Steel. Following a period of financial instability, British Steel was taken over by the government\\'s insolvency service in 2019 and then acquired by Chinese steel-making firm Jingye the following year. In late March 2025, Jingye said the plant was losing around £700,000 a day and launched a consultation on its closure. The government held talks with Jingye aimed at keeping the plant operational. After these appeared to have largely broken down, emergency legislation was fast-tracked through Parliament in a single day on Saturday - handing control of the plant to the government. Jingye still owns the site, but the business secretary now has sweeping powers to control management and workers to make sure production continues. This means British Steel has not been nationalised - which is when a government takes ownership and control of a company. But Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds acknowledged that public ownership was \"the likely option\". While the government hopes to secure private investment to save the plant, ministers admit there are currently no companies willing to buy it.\\n\\nReuters\\n\\nWhy did the government step in?\\n\\nThe supplies needed to keep the blast furnaces running - coking coal and iron pellets - are running low at the Scunthorpe plant. This added time pressure to the talks, because once a blast furnace shuts down it is a costly and complex process to restart it. Unions said the situation was on a \"cliff-edge,\" while the Community Union described the lack of supplies as an \"extreme emergency\". The government offered to buy the raw materials needed to keep the furnaces running earlier this week, but Jingye did not agree to that proposal. In the Commons on Saturday, the business secretary said Jingye had wanted \"an excessive amount\" of money. He said it had become clear during negotiations that the company intended to \"refuse\" to buy enough material to keep the furnaces running, and \"to cancel and refuse to pay for existing orders\". \"The company would therefore have irrevocably and unilaterally closed down primary steel making at British Steel,\" he added. The emergency law gives the government the ability to order raw materials to keep the furnaces running, and to direct the company\\'s workforce and board. The government has told the company\\'s UK management to keep the site operational, and the new law will ensure that any employees who are sacked by the Chinese owners can be reinstated.\\n\\nGetty Images Sir Keir Starmer has said he is committed to keeping UK steel operations going\\n\\nWhy is the Scunthorpe plant losing money?\\n\\nJingye said the blast furnaces were \"no longer financially sustainable,\" blaming \"highly challenging\" market conditions, tariffs and costs associated with transitioning to lower-carbon production techniques. UK steel production has been falling for several decades and the financial pressures facing the industry were heightened in March when the US imposed a 25% tariff on any steel it imports. Global over-production of steel has created \"a glut of steel on the international market\", according to a UK government briefing on the industry, which has pushed prices down. British manufacturers also face higher costs, particularly on electricity, than elsewhere.\\n\\nWho else produces steel in the UK?',\n",

In a speech at the event, he called on prosecutors to work to restore order and peace. He claimed the student-led protests had been threatening Serbia\\'s peace and stability, accusing attendees of being paid by \"foreign intelligence agencies\". \"Certain foreign powers cannot bear to see a free, independent and sovereign Serbia\", he said, without clarifying which \"powers\" he was referring to.

       "  'text': 'Government bonds have been selling off while stocks have plunged. That’s unusual, and it’s raising concerns that global investors are losing some of their long-standing confidence in America.\\n\\nStocks are generally seen as a risky type of asset, while bonds are known as a “safe haven,” with the two typically moving in opposite directions. That’s because government bonds — a type of security sold to help finance expenditures, to be paid back to buyers with interest over a set period — are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.\\n\\nThe same can’t be said for publicly traded companies and their share prices. So when stock markets are booming and investors are excited to bet on the performance of American businesses, demand for lower-risk bonds dries up. During times of turbulence, the reverse usually happens.\\n\\nWe don’t know exactly why bonds are gyrating so much. Barclays Analyst Ajay Rajadhyaksha\\n\\nInstead, the two markets have seen simultaneous sell-offs. The premier U.S. government bond, the 10-year Treasury note, saw its yield surge above 4.5% this week.\\n\\nBond prices and yields are inversely correlated, so rising yields signal lower appetite for the bonds. The 10-year Treasury yield ended the week more than 12% higher, while the S&P 500 closed out a week of volatile trading up 5.7%, rebounding late Friday after a series of brutal losses.\\n\\n“We don’t know exactly why bonds are gyrating so much,” Barclays analyst Ajay Rajadhyaksha said in a note to clients Friday that he titled “This is not normal.”\\n\\nSoaring yields on 10- and 30-year Treasurys make it costlier for the federal government to borrow money. It’s also bad news for consumers because the 10-year note’s yield is directly linked to rates for mortgages, credit cards and personal and business loans.\\n\\n“This matters to nearly all Americans,” said Natalie Colley, a partner and financial planner at the New York-based firm Francis Financial.\\n\\n“Gone are the days of a pension,” she said, referring to the more than 70 million U.S. savers with access to 401(k) retirement accounts tied to markets. Volatility on Wall Street has unnerved many account holders in recent weeks, forcing some financial planners to do double duty as therapists to rattled clients.\\n\\n“If Treasurys are not a safe-haven asset, that has major implications for balance sheets across the board — businesses, nonprofits, pensions, households,” said Ernie Tedeschi, a former top economist in the Biden administration who’s now the director of economics at Yale University’s Budget Lab. “So much of world finance is predicated on U.S. Treasurys being safe.”\\n\\nHe called recent bond market trends “the most concerning piece of data since the tariffs began.”\\n\\n“It’s showing a deterioration in confidence in the U.S.’s place in the world,” he said.\\n\\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent has pushed back against such concerns, telling Fox Business on Wednesday, “There is nothing systemic about this. I think that it is an uncomfortable but normal deleveraging that’s going on in the bond market.”\\n\\nBut experts see warning signs elsewhere, too. The value of the dollar relative to other global currencies has nosedived. This week it suffered its biggest drop since 2022 and ended Friday at its lowest level since September.\\n\\n“Everything in the U.S. is not doing well right now,” Kyla Scanlon, a financial educator and author of “In This Economy?: How Money and Markets Really Work,” told her TikTok followers this week. “The U.S. dollar is getting crushed.”\\n\\nShe chalked up the currency’s decline to “the erratic trade policy that we’ve seen,” adding: “Markets don’t believe that the U.S. has a stable or clear economic plan.”\\n\\nNeel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, flagged similar concerns.\\n\\n“Normally when you see big tariff increases, I would have expected the dollar to go up. The fact that the dollar is going down at the same time I think lends some more credibility to the story of investor preferences shifting,” he told CNBC on Friday.\\n\\nThere are several other possible explanations. One has to do with the way hedge funds bet on bond markets. Another could be that investors are anticipating a run-up in inflation and demanding higher interest rates now so they don’t lose money in the future.\\n\\n“Maybe they feel, or the market feels, that the actions around tariffs are actually going to create upward inflationary pressure,” said Douglas Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth, an advisory firm in New York. “That very well could be part of the puzzle here.”\\n\\nEven experts who are more hesitant to assign a cause to the bond sell-off say geopolitical factors are hard to ignore.\\n\\nSo much of world finance is predicated on U.S. Treasurys being safe. Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics, yale budget lab\\n\\n“The idea of other countries turning away from America, I don’t want to go down that rabbit hole necessarily,” said Lee Baker, founder of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta. “But in this particular instance, America turned away from everybody else” with steep new trade barriers.\\n\\nFor now, Baker and other wealth advisers are cautioning clients not to react hastily to the recent volatility. Younger investors who aren’t close to retirement — and typically have less exposure to the bond market — should stay the course, Colley said.\\n\\n“Making sure that you’re in an appropriate asset allocation for your stage in life” and building up some emergency savings can help create a “financial moat that will insulate any investor at any point in their investing career from feeling panic around what’s going on in the stock market,” she said. If possible, she recommends keeping at least six months’ of cash on hand for a rainy day.\\n\\nOlder retirement savers can consider some protective measures, Baker said.\\n\\nHis firm has been building buffer exchange-traded funds — so-called “defined-outcome” ETFs tied to options contracts — into clients’ portfolios. These funds tend to be more expensive and typically cap potential gains, but they offer robust downside protections and have seen a recent surge in interest. BlackRock launched a new iShares buffer ETF earlier this year, billing it as a way of “mitigating risk while participating in market growth.”\\n\\nBaker added that “there’s a whole lot of other stuff in the world beyond stocks and bonds” to consider investing in, such as real estate, infrastructure and private equity. But he cautioned that it’s usually a good idea to consult a qualified adviser first, partly to avoid making important money moves out of fear.\\n\\n“It’s probably not a good idea to go whole hog in any of these,” he said, “but we can certainly reduce your downside while giving you some upside with a combination of these things.”',\n",

       "  'publish_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 4, 11, 14, 49, 20),\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. consumer sentiment plunged in April, the fourth consecutive month of declines, in a seemingly sharp rebuke of President Donald Trump’s trade wars that have fueled anxiety over possible job losses and rising inflation.\\n\\nThe preliminary reading of the University of Michigan’s closely watched consumer sentiment index, released Friday, fell 11% on a monthly basis to 50.8, the lowest since the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the past year, sentiment has tumbled 34%.\\n\\nThe decline was “pervasive and unanimous across age, income, education, geographic region, and political affiliation,” said Joanne Hsu, director of the survey.\\n\\nThe share of respondents expecting unemployment to rise in the coming months increased for the fifth straight month and is now the highest since 2009 during the Great Recession.\\n\\nWhile consumer sentiment is not always a reliable indicator of the overall economy, it has at times reflected shifting vibes in how the public feels about presidential leadership. Sentiment among Republicans has dropped 6% over the past month as Trump teased, then rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs, only to institute a 90-day pause of some import taxes Wednesday.\\n\\n“Interestingly, President Trump appears to be getting much of the blame for much of the deterioration in sentiment with 67% of respondents saying the government is doing a ‘poor job’ on fighting inflation and unemployment,” said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING. “Only 18% say it is doing a ‘good job.’”\\n\\nAsked at Friday’s news briefing about the falling consumer sentiment, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the public should trust in Trump as he executes his tariffs plan.\\n\\n“As he said, this is going to be a period of transition,” she said. “He wants consumers to trust in him, and they should trust in him.”\\n\\nThe result of the trade war drama so far is a baseline tariff on most countries of 10%, with imports from China getting taxed at a combined 145%. Goods from Canada and Mexico face tariffs of up to 25%, while imported autos, steel and aluminum are taxed at that same rate. China retaliated Wednesday with a 125% tariff on U.S. goods.\\n\\nThe Trump administration has suggested that it cut new trade agreements with more than 75 nations over a span of 90 days.\\n\\n“We are doing really well on our TARIFF POLICY,” Trump said Friday on his social media site Truth Social. “Very exciting for America, and the World!!! It is moving along quickly.”\\n\\nEroding American confidence has also surfaced in the financial markets. Investors are selling off U.S. debt. The interest rate on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note was at 4.48% on Friday afternoon, up from roughly 4% at the start of the week. That suggests more economic instability ahead.\\n\\nOn Friday, the dollar slumped to a three-year low against the euro.\\n\\nLarry Fink, CEO of the investment firm BlackRock, told CNBC that the U.S. economy is on the cusp of a downturn, if not already there.\\n\\n“I think we’re very close, if not in, a recession now,” Fink said.\\n\\nThe Michigan sentiment survey found that people now expect long-term inflation to reach 4.4%, up from 4.1% last month, a move that may be of particular concern for the U.S. Federal Reserve. The Fed pays close attention to inflation expectations, because they can become self-fulfilling. If people expect prices to rise, they often take steps that can push up prices, such as accelerating purchases or seeking higher wages.\\n\\nIt’s a sign that most of the public views as a blip data this week showing that consumer inflation declined in March to an annual rate of 2.4%. Most economists believe that, given the intensifying trade wars, inflation is likely to be reignited.\\n\\nAmericans’ inflation expectations over the next five years are now at the highest since 1991, according to Capital Economics, a forecasting firm.\\n\\n“Households appear to have come to the same conclusion as markets: the tariffs will do lasting damage to the US economy,” Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said in an email.\\n\\nConsumer sentiment remains sharply divided by party, with the index for Democrats at 34.1 and Republicans at 81.9. Yet both recorded steep drops in April.\\n\\nSentiment among independents plunged to 46.8 from 55.7, and is sharply below its post-election peak of 70.2.

       "  'text': \"Ryan Haines / Android Authority\\n\\nIf you want flagship features without the price tag, there’s a good selection of options on the market right now. Google’s new Pixel 9a joins the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE and Apple iPhone 16e as great middle-of-the-market picks for the budget-conscious. In fact, the 9a is the cheapest of the three at just $499 rather than $659 and $599, respectively, yet it continues to sport a dual camera configuration and flagship-tier Tensor G4 processor. Can it really be that good of a deal?\\n\\nIf you’ve been wondering which of these three phones nails the smartphone fundamentals the best, then you’ve come to the right place. I’ve run each through our benchmarking suite to see which will best handle daily workloads, heavier use cases, and intensive gaming sessions.

Discover Authority Insights for more exclusive reports, app teardowns, leaks, and in-depth tech coverage you won’t find anywhere else.\\n\\nPixel 9a vs Galaxy S24 FE vs iPhone 16e benchmarks Let’s dive right in to see how Apple’s A18, Google’s Tensor G4, and Samsung’s Exynos 2400e — all developed in-house — compare in the industry’s most popular benchmarks. We’ll start our tests with a run of GeekBench 6, giving us a look at how the phone’s processors handle single-core bound tasks, like booting up an app or web page for the first time, and more typical multi-core situations like flicking through social apps or your image gallery.\\n\\nRobert Triggs / Android Authority\\n\\nApple’s custom CPU cores held a significant advantage over its Android rivals until Qualcomm’s Oryon CPU core came along. However, neither the Pixel 9a nor Galaxy S24 FE have those, so we’re back to seeing a significant lead for Apple over Arm Cortex cores in both single- and multi-core scenarios. Apple’s single-core win is particularly huge, virtually doubling the performance of the Pixel 9a. Thankfully, the Galaxy S24 FE closes the gap in multi-core situations, which are far more common nowadays.\\n\\nApple has the faster CPU, but Samsung's GPU will be the gamer's choice.\\n\\nMore performance is better, of course, but there’s a bit of a ceiling for what you’ll need for your day-to-day tasks. Browsing the web and posting to social runs perfectly fine on the Pixel 9a. Instead, you’ll need really CPU-intensive tasks (like video editing) to feel the difference in real apps. Still, the iPhone 16e is definitely the most future-proof, but I’m a little concerned about how well the Pixel 9a will handle whatever apps we’re all running on our phones five or six years down the line.\\n\\nWhen it comes to graphics, all three of these phones have some compromises compared to the fastest in the business. The iPhone 16e’s A18 chip has just four GPU cores, down from five in the regular iPhone 16 and six in the Pro models. Likewise, the Galaxy S24 FE’s last-gen Exynos 2400e chip has a slightly older GPU design, and Google’s use of a mid-tier Arm Mali setup has never been benchmark-topping. Still, this makes for a rather interesting comparison.\\n\\nRobert Triggs / Android Authority\\n\\nJust last year, the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE’s Xclipse 940 graphics chip was a top-tier flagship GPU. It is clearly leaps and bounds ahead of the competition in both quick bursts and prolonged gaming sessions. Its drop to 71.9% of its best result in 3DMark’s Wild Life Extreme Stress Test isn’t particularly great, but its large head start over the competition means that it never really comes close to closing the gap.\\n\\nThe Pixel 9a lands at the bottom of the pile on a quick test, but the phone holds up better under moderate stress compared to the iPhone 16e. Apple’s budget model gives up most of its performance, falling to just 70.4% of its peak, without much temperature build-up, falling below the budget Pixel under moderate load. By the end of our 20-minute stress test, the three were back in their starting order, although the performance gap had narrowed somewhat, owing to the Pixel 9a’s pretty decent 79.1% stability score and temperature.\\n\\nWhich is the best mid-range performer?\\n\\nRyan Haines / Android Authority\\n\\nAt first glance, Apple might appear to come out on top when it comes to packing a high-performing chip in an affordable smartphone. However, the iPhone 16e’s undeniable CPU advantage is unlikely to make much of a meaningful difference to your daily experience. Especially as the phone has inferior battery life compared to the Galaxy S24 FE and ranks even further behind the incredibly frugal Google Pixel 9a. Furthermore, the phone doesn’t quite have the graphics grunt of Apple’s more expensive flagships and can become hot enough to throttle hard in longer sessions. The iPhone 16e is a reasonable effort from Apple but doesn’t necessarily strike the ideal balance.\\n\\nStill, outside of heavy emulation, high-end mobile games don’t push handsets quite as hard as our stress test, meaning all three of these phones will handle even some of the market’s most intensive mobile games without too much issue. You might have to turn some settings down to hit 60fps on supported titles. But if you’re looking to do a lot of gaming on a budget or plan to keep playing long into the decade, the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE strikes the best balance of day-to-day performance with more powerful gaming capabilities. That said, it is the most expensive of the three phones, so be prepared to pay for those extra frames.\\n\\nThe Galaxy S24 FE strikes the best performance balance, but you'll have to pay more for it.\\n\\nThat leaves the Google Pixel 9a last but by no means least. Granted, it doesn’t win any of our benchmarks, and I am a little concerned about exactly how well the phone will hold up come the end of its seven years of software support compared to the other two, which will see equally long lifespans. However, the Tensor G4 inside the Pixel 9a performs virtually identically to the one in the Pixel 9, and that phone’s no slouch. Given it’s a good deal cheaper than the iPhone 16e and Galaxy S24 FE, it’s still really in the mix and will take you through a busy workday and more without dropping the ball.\\n\\nIt might be a cop-out, but there’s not really a bad pick between these three; it all depends on your budget. Of course, there’s plenty more that makes a great phone too, including the camera, battery life, and software features that will probably tilt the scales one way or the other. Speaking of battery life, I’ll be looking more closely at how these three mid-range models stack up against each other there as well in another article, so stay tuned.\",\n",

From \"vibe\" coding to GitHub Copilot to startups building quick-and-dirty applications with support from LLMs, AI is already deeply integrated.\\n\\nHowever, those claiming we\\'re mere months away from AI agents replacing most programmers should adjust their expectations because models aren\\'t good enough at the debugging part, and debugging occupies most of a developer\\'s time. That\\'s the suggestion of Microsoft Research, which built a new tool called debug-gym to test and improve how AI models can debug software.\\n\\nDebug-gym (available on GitHub and detailed in a blog post) is an environment that allows AI models to try and debug any existing code repository with access to debugging tools that aren\\'t historically part of the process for these models.

With the approach, they\\'re better but still a far cry from what an experienced human developer can do.\\n\\nHere\\'s how Microsoft\\'s researchers describe debug-gym:\\n\\nDebug-gym expands an agent’s action and observation space with feedback from tool usage, enabling setting breakpoints, navigating code, printing variable values, and creating test functions. Agents can interact with tools to investigate code or rewrite it, if confident. We believe interactive debugging with proper tools can empower coding agents to tackle real-world software engineering tasks and is central to LLM-based agent research. The fixes proposed by a coding agent with debugging capabilities, and then approved by a human programmer, will be grounded in the context of the relevant codebase, program execution and documentation, rather than relying solely on guesses based on previously seen training data.\\n\\nPictured below are the results of the tests using debug-gym.',\n",

       "  'publish_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 4, 12, 0, 0),\n",
       "  'text': 'Bungie\\n\\nAt 1 PM ET today, Bungie will launch a lengthy Marathon reveal stream that will be the first official look at gameplay of its coming hero/extraction shooter. To date, we got one trailer over a year ago, some concept art and some ARGs (the stream has also been live for 20 hours already, showing MIDA messages and some map and weapon previews).\\n\\nI will dip into meme territory here with the good old “make or break” declaration but I’m…actually pretty serious this time around. Marathon is a massively important game for both the future of Bungie and the live-service ambitions for PlayStation. The situation:\\n\\nBungie\\n\\nBungie has been in a tough spot for a while now, effectively half the size it used to be a few years ago after layoffs, voluntary departures and parts of the company carved off by Sony after its acquisition. Right now, Bungie is two games, Destiny 2 and Marathon.\\n\\nDestiny 2, in just a few months, is headed into an entirely new era of content, less content, from everything we know. We are switching from one big expansion, four seasons/3 episodes, a raid and two dungeons to two smaller expansions, four “major updates” and one raid and dungeon. The quality of the content is yet to be seen, but it is less, and the plan is to maintain this cadence for years, with no indication Destiny 3 is coming in the next half-decade, the one thing that could spark a resurgence in the playerbase.\\n\\nDestiny has been entirety of Bungie’s published work the last decade, but now Marathon will arrive and be a significant part of that going forward. If the game is not a hit of at least some size, that will deal a huge blow to Bungie, one it may not survive. But in contrast, a successful launch may secure Bungie’s fortunes well into the future even if Destiny remains scaled back. Its history of stellar shooters puts the odds in its favor, certainly.\\n\\nBungie\\n\\nSony\\n\\n“Break” may be a bit overstating it here, as Marathon doesn’t have the potential to sink the entire PlayStation brand. However, Marathon is currently the biggest live service game arriving in Sony’s roster after cancelled projects, one epic disaster (you know which game) and only one truly major hit, Helldivers 2, which as settled into a cadence of about 10% of its playerbase since it launch in in February of 2024 (still, I’d consider it a success).\\n\\nMarathon is the first new Bungie IP in a decade, a company with a history of producing shooter-based hits. Again, if Marathon does not land and becomes another also-ran, it’s hard not to see that as a deep cut to Sony’s stated plan of developing loads of live service games. That has already been damaged the last two years or so, but Marathon failing? That would set them incredibly far back.\\n\\nSony\\n\\nAgain, in contrast, Marathon being a hit would be huge for Sony, proving they can in fact dig up live hits and their $3.6 billion purchase of Bungie is bearing new fruit, and it was a good investment. It would shift the narrative away from its last high profile bomb (Concord, and there is a zero percent chance Marathon will be another Concord) and into what could be the best new shooter on the market. Albeit a very, very competitive market to break into in the days of eternal staples like Fortnite, Call of Duty, Apex and so on. And if it is a hit, it’s also on Xbox meaning Sony’s reach would extend to its rival to farm purchase and microtransaction cash from that playerbase as well.\\n\\nThere’s no way around it, this is a hugely important game for both entities, and I don’t think I’m overstating it. The buzz around Marathon in the lead-up to its reveal here is largely positive, essentially the opposite of Concord which looked bad from the start. Marathon, at least in terms of its art direction, score and lore, has seemed excellent. Hopefully that is in fact true.\\n\\nFollow me on Twitter , YouTube , and Bluesky',\n",

       "  'publish_date': None,\n",
       "  'text': 'It sounds like a dream to spend an entire day with the brand new Nintendo Switch 2 playing all the new games Nintendo threw at me during a special press preview. Believe me, it was an unforgettable experience, particularly now that because of tariffs, pre-orders in the US and Canada are on hold, while the initial batch in the UK sold out quickly. I just didn\\'t expect it to be a workout using the controllers in ways I\\'d never anticipated.\\n\\nFor example, pushing my hands around a fabric-covered table while holding two mouse controllers is surprisingly tiring. I was playing Drag x Drive, a new wheelchair sports game coming for the Nintendo Switch 2 that uses one of the console\\'s new features: Joy-Cons, which work like computer mice. I felt vibrations under my hands as though I was spinning my wheels. But I wondered: Who will play the Switch 2 while seated at a table? I realized later that you can also rub them on your pants legs to make them work. So I did that, too. It was a little less tiring.\\n\\nThis was just one weird part of a long day playing the Nintendo Switch 2, the $450 sequel to one of Nintendo\\'s most popular game consoles ever, arriving June 5, with preorders opening soon. I\\'ve loved playing games on the Switch, like many people. However, the Switch 2, while being a new console, feels a lot like an updated version of a system many people already own.\\n\\nWatch this: We Played Nintendo Switch 2: Mario, Donkey Kong, Mouse, Camera and a Lot More 08:02\\n\\nMuch like the PlayStation 5 or the Xbox Series X, it\\'s betting that playing games that look a little better matters enough to upgrade. But Nintendo\\'s also laying down some side bets on new features that could make a difference: in-game voice chat with friends at the press of a button, a plug-in camera that can work with wacky party games and, yeah, new controllers that double as mice.\\n\\nSo here\\'s the question: Is this more fun than the existing Switch and its games? I\\'d say the Switch 2 is a better piece of hardware, no doubt, but the upgrade proposition feels pretty uncertain until Nintendo shows many more games that make it worth it.\\n\\nThe Switch 2 feels big, for sure, but not that much bigger than the Switch OLED. Scott Stein/CNET\\n\\nThat being said, the Switch 2, as a bigger, better version of the existing Switch, could make a lot of sense for those who can afford it, especially because there\\'s still nothing quite like it out there. At $450 (£395, AU$699), plus $70 or $80 for its two biggest launch-window games, Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza, this is an expensive proposition for any family right now. A CNET survey recently found that affordability is the top concern for US gamers considering the purchase. Then again, as a handheld game console with its own included dock that can also play games in 4K on a TV, it\\'s actually competitively priced versus the Steam Deck and Windows gaming handhelds.\\n\\nI played Mario Kart World. I played Donkey Kong Bananza. I played remastered versions of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, and Kirby and the Forgotten Land. I played Cyberpunk 2077 and Split Fiction. And I played Mario Party Jamboree with new mouse-Joy-Con and camera-optional modes that projected me onto the TV. It was all fun and the Switch 2 is the handheld I\\'d prefer to play my library of Switch games on. But I don\\'t think it\\'s a necessary upgrade for anyone right now. That said, your kids will probably ask for Mario Kart World and a Switch 2.\\n\\nThe 7.9-inch display is a welcome upgrade (for me). Numi Prasarn/CNET\\n\\nHands-on with the handheld: Nice screen, larger feel, similar buttons\\n\\nThe Switch 2 is big and feels dense. It\\'s not that much bigger than the Switch OLED, to me, but that larger 7.9-inch screen feels welcome. I play on a large Steam Deck a lot lately and the Switch 2 feels sort of like that but actually thinner. It\\'s about the same thickness as the Switch in casual holding-and-looking comparisons.\\n\\nThe Switch 2 has an LCD, not OLED, like the last iteration of the Switch, which went on sale in 2021. But honestly, it looked great to me in the hours I tried it. The 1080p resolution, HDR capabilities and refresh rate that can go up to 120Hz, depending on the game, stood out while playing. I\\'d take this over the Switch OLED display right now.\\n\\nThe larger Joy-Cons now magnetically snap in and out but have little release buttons on the back. They snap in smoothly and then you eject them with the trigger release and remove them. It\\'s a smooth action and a lot easier than pressing that small button on the current Switch Joy-Cons. The controllers, although feeling sturdy, have a surprisingly similar feel. The analog sticks felt like existing Joy-Cons and the buttons clicked similarly. I\\'m bummed that there\\'s no analog rear trigger.\\n\\nThe Switch 2 Joy-Con, with its new C button. Scott Stein/CNET\\n\\nInstead, these triggers click just like the older Switch -- something that the Switch 2\\'s producers and directors, in a roundtable chat during my New York demo day, said was decided upon because they offer a more immediate response in games. I think it\\'s a miss because every other console I\\'ve played has analog triggers and they work well. Putting analog triggers on a Switch 2 would have made previous Switch games feel different on the Switch 2, though, and maybe that\\'s where the challenge lay.\\n\\nThe C button on the right Joy-Con launches Game Chat, a new mode that allows four-player audio chats with trusted Switch friends (that can be parent-approved). These chats can also become grainy video chats with an optional plug-in camera that can be used with the Switch when docked. Nintendo sells its own stand-like camera for $50 but you could also use a third-party camera (mileage may vary, according to Nintendo).\\n\\nThe new Switch 2 camera, which plugs in and can be used for games or video chats. Scott Stein/CNET\\n\\nI didn\\'t get to try Game Chat during the demo day but I\\'m curious about how good the audio quality and noise cancellation are. Nintendo says it\\'s good enough to filter around room noise while talking from across the room. The Switch 2 has a microphone but the Joy-Cons don\\'t. A new $80 Switch 2 Pro Controller, which feels similar to the previous Switch Pro Controller with two added rear paddle buttons, does have a headphone jack that can be used to connect a microphone-enabled headset.\\n\\nThe new Switch 2 dock has its own fan system and looks chunky. It\\'ll sit near a TV so you probably won\\'t mind but it\\'s a bigger unit than before and, like several accessories, won\\'t work with the first-gen Switch. It enables 4K gaming modes on TVs, though, so that\\'s the reason.\\n\\nThe Switch 2 kickstand is pretty flexible. Scott Stein/CNET\\n\\nThere\\'s a new Switch 2 kickstand, which tilts at a wider range of angles. But it\\'s made of plastic and feels a bit flimsier than I expected, although it holds its position well. And there are two USB-C ports now -- one on top, one on bottom -- but it turns out the top port won\\'t do video-out. Nintendo\\'s creative team told me at a developer roundtable that there are no plans to support plug-in display glasses such as the Xreal One, a trick the Steam Deck and Windows handhelds can pull off.\\n\\nI like the way the Switch 2 feels, though. It seems like it\\'ll be easier to travel with than Windows handhelds and the Steam Deck, which have bulky side grips that add to the system\\'s case size needs. The Switch 2 rides somewhat flat, although it\\'s bigger and longer.\\n\\nOK, at this point, you\\'re probably saying, \"Scott, please, just talk about the games.\" So, I played each game in roughly 20-minute sessions as we were shuttled around different stations in the New York exhibition space that will host the public Switch 2 Experience. It\\'ll work similarly at other Switch 2 Experience locations, too.\\n\\nI thought I won in Mario Kart. I didn\\'t. Bridget Carey/CNET\\n\\nMario Kart World: Open-world Mario Kart madness\\n\\nI have no idea how big Mario Kart World is. I drove around freely for a few minutes before a race mode started and I madly rambled from a town to a farm to an arena to mountain roads, jumped on train tracks, hopped on a power line and rode it up in the air, knocked down a lot of fences and found some sinister Bowser-ish castle. The newest Mario Kart game, a Switch 2 exclusive and launch title, is clearly the \"game to get.\" What I love is the sense that this racing game could be as full of surprises as an open-world Mario game.\\n\\nIt\\'s Grand Theft Mario or Mario Horizon or whatever you want to call it. This open expanse game\\'s real estate makes it far vaster than existing Mario Karts. But I played two races, mostly. I don\\'t even remember exactly what the course looked like because I was so busy navigating against 23 other players. The 24-player gameplay is new and, combined with wider, more expansive-feeling tracks, it\\'s a lot to take in. There are a lot of new characters to choose from -- I picked Luigi with a gondolier outfit and later a hamburger-hatted Toad and Donkey Kong with battle armor. There are bikes, cars and all sorts of other familiar vehicles.\\n\\nA new knockout tournament mode has players racing across multiple tracks in a world-spanning rally to win. You\\'re eliminated if you\\'re in the bottom four. I thought I came in first and got way too excited but I was one lap short of the actual end. I came in 16th. Competitiveness in a field full of this many cars reaches total absurdity.\\n\\nI want to play more. The game looks great and handles like classic Mario Kart but it\\'s the extras that make me curious.\\n\\nDonkey Kong Bananza: Showcase for smashing stuff\\n\\nNintendo doesn\\'t have a new 3D Mario game for the Switch 2 yet but Donkey Kong Bananza looks like a solid replacement. It\\'s the first open-world (sensing a theme here?) Donkey Kong game in years. It\\'s also a Switch 2 exclusive, coming July 17. Nobody saw this game coming (well, almost nobody) and I liked what I tried.\\n\\nThe game\\'s biggest mechanic is digging and destroying nearly everything. Donkey Kong can burrow through walls or the ground and, depending on the level, you can burrow far. I started digging into a wall in my first cave-like level, got lost in my tunneling, then burst out again. Some areas have you digging all the way down to new depths, almost like Tears of the Kingdom (but not really). Where does the madness end?\\n\\nDonkey Kong is full of goofy expressions and enemies look dynamic in a way that feels almost like Sony\\'s Ratchet and Clank games. It\\'s a loud and fun action adventure but I have no idea how long the game actually is. It did showcase a lot more particles of stuff flying around than the older Switch has pulled off and the graphics kept a crisp frame rate.\\n\\nMetroid Prime 4 Beyond: A technical showcase for graphics (and the mouse mode)\\n\\nMy 20 minutes or so with Metroid Prime 4 made me realize how good Switch 2 games could look. Running at 1080p and 120Hz on a big TV, it moved extremely smoothly and was as impressive a shooter as I\\'ve ever seen on a Nintendo console. From landing on a barren planet to firing through waves of creatures, rolling around in ball mode and losing a tough battle against a big ugly boss, it won me over.\\n\\nI played on TV mode only, using the Joy-Cons in standard controller mode and then a mouse-and-controller mode. You can put one Joy-Con down at any time and make it a mouse for controlling movement, just like on a PC. I loved the fast reaction feel of it and I also liked that I could just lift my hand up and go back to analog stick controls if I changed my mind midstream.\\n\\nSwitch 2 Welcome Tour: Why isn\\'t this free?\\n\\nI was expecting a dose of the weird at Nintendo\\'s Switch 2 event but this wasn\\'t it. Still, the idea of a Welcome Tour isn\\'t bad. Much like Valve\\'s Aperture Desk Job and the PlayStation 5\\'s Astro\\'s Playroom (or several tutorial apps for the Meta Quest), this looks like a guided tour of the Switch 2\\'s features, complete with insights from Nintendo and mini-games. I played a few, some of which were more like glorified demos at best.\\n\\nI dodged asteroids using a Joy-Con in mouse mode, played the first level of Super Mario Bros. in pixel-accurate mode on a 4K TV setting to show how much screen real estate is available and played a guessing game for what frame rate a bouncing ball was moving at. One \"game\" showed me HDR on and off while launching fireworks. The problem is, this is a paid digital game, instead of the freebie it clearly should have been. I can\\'t understand why this probably helpful system tutorial isn\\'t just included on the Switch 2 and I never will.\\n\\nThe standard way we held and used Joy-Cons as mice during our game demos. Fun but you need a table (unless you use them on your legs). Bridget Carey/CNET\\n\\nDrag x Drive: Nintendo\\'s wild-card game\\n\\nSomewhere between Arms and Rocket League, Drag x Drive is a Switch 2 exclusive that uses the Joy-Cons in mouse mode to control wheelchair-using players in an intense hoop-shooting sports game. Moving each wheel requires pushing one Joy-Con forward and backward. It gets intense fast.\\n\\nThe feeling ends up being a bit like rowing and my arms tired out; you have to keep wheeling around and moving your arms rapidly, pretty much nonstop. One neat thing is you can feel rumbling haptic clicks beneath your controllers as you \"wheel,\" making it feel more convincing. Racing to the ball, hitting other players and shooting baskets felt as chaotic as a game of Rocket League. I\\'m not sure if I\\'ll ever find this game fun to play because of its seemingly high exertion requirements but I enjoyed trying it for a while.\\n\\nMario Party Jamboree uses the Switch 2 camera to project yourself into the game. Numi Prasarn/CNET\\n\\nMario Party Jamboree flexes camera, mouse modes\\n\\nThe most wacky stuff I tried were probably the new mini-games for the Switch 2 update of Mario Party Jamboree, which add mini-games that work with the Joy-Cons\\' new mouse features and a game mode that uses the optional plug-in camera.\\n\\nBridget Carey and I revved little wind-up cars by pulling back on the Joy-Con mouse and releasing it to launch forward, with vibrating haptics to add clicking feedback. We played air hockey by pushing our Mouse-Cons around the table to hit the Koopa shells flying back and forth. And then we screamed and danced and balanced shells on our heads in camera mini-games that made us look like we were transported into Mario Party, popping out of warp pipes.\\n\\nThe camera-based games were flashbacks to the days when the PlayStation had a TV camera and the Xbox had the Kinect, which both did similar things. It was definitely fun and it makes Mario Party Jamboree even better but I don\\'t know how much I\\'d feel compelled to play the new modes long-term.\\n\\nPlaying Tears of the Kingdom on the Switch 2: better, by degrees. Bridget Carey/CNET\\n\\nUpdated Switch games look better -- for a price\\n\\nI played a handful of games optimized for the Switch 2, which will be sold in Switch 2 Editions at a higher price or existing game owners can buy a digital upgrade. The upgrades can be free in some cases if you have the Nintendo Switch Online Plus membership, while others will cost you extra, regardless.\\n\\nZelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, the Switch\\'s two epic Zeldas, both have Switch 2 upgrades I briefly played. For sure, they look better, with better frame rates. I\\'d prefer to play them this way but the difference wasn\\'t massive. The Switch 2 versions also gain compatibility with a new phone app companion called Zelda Notes that we didn\\'t get to demo.\\n\\nKirby and the Forgotten Land has a new story mode and better-looking graphics on Switch 2. I had fun playing a bit of the new storyline, which involved a lot of freezing-up landscapes. Is it worth the upgrade price? Maybe, because it also has some DLC extras.\\n\\nF-Zero GX on GameCube... (Make a new F-Zero, please.) Numi Prasarn/CNET\\n\\nGameCube Mode ... activated!\\n\\nNintendo is adding another bonus to the Switch 2 equation with a Nintendo GameCube virtual console library. It\\'s part of the Switch Online Plus Expansion Pack subscription but Switch owners cannot play those GameCube games.\\n\\nThere are only a few GameCube games expected at the Switch 2 launch but I gave a few a quick play to remind myself of when I played them back in my own GameCube days: Wind Waker and F-Zero GX. Wind Waker is a classic Zelda and I loved F-Zero GX, which was co-developed by Sega. It still feels ridiculously fast. Nintendo\\'s selling a GameCube wireless controller, which I also tried out. The buttons and sticks feel just like they used to.\\n\\nPorts of new third-party games: Are they good enough?\\n\\nPart of the Switch 2\\'s appeal to other non-Nintendo gamers is its ability to play games that PC, Xbox and PlayStation folks could play but Switch owners couldn\\'t. Elden Ring, Madden, Cyberpunk 2077 and Split Fiction are some of the biggest newcomers. The performance, from my quick early plays, was a mixed bag. Split Fiction is a hit co-op game that debuted this year and I love it on the Switch but the split-screen gameplay I tried had less than stellar frame rates and graphics quality. It was fun but didn\\'t look beautiful.\\n\\nCyberpunk 2077 shows off sprawling cityscapes but again, on a big TV, it was clearly not as good as what you could get from a PS5 or Xbox. Madden and Elden Ring weren\\'t there.\\n\\nI know what playing games like these feels like on handhelds, though. The Steam Deck already has Elden Ring, Split Fiction and Cyberpunk 2077 support. The Switch 2 looks like a strong competitor to the Steam Deck and current Windows gaming handhelds for a wave of third-party games that\\'ll finally play decently. Still, I\\'m not sure how much it\\'ll convince Steam Deck owners or Windows handheld owners as the whole appeal of those systems is they\\'ll play PC games you already own.\\n\\nIt shows some promise for the Switch 2 being a step up for playing current-gen games but Nintendo didn\\'t share any details on how powerful the Nvidia processor onboard is. It\\'s capable of ray tracing and can upscale game graphics but what are the limits?\\n\\nVerdict for now: The best Switch, but not yet a necessary one\\n\\nI wanted more from the Switch 2. More surprises, more wow factor. That being said, it looks like easily the best Switch upgrade since 2017. And yet why do I feel like it\\'s not a must-buy yet? Because the games, as fun as they were, weren\\'t doing anything totally new. Because Nintendo raised prices for a lot of things, including more expensive games, Switch 2 Edition modes and even that tutorial game. And because, well, the world\\'s not in a great economic place right now.\\n\\nI still want one and want to play Nintendo\\'s new games, though. Nintendo brings joy and unique experiences. In 2025, it\\'s the biggest thing gaming has. And the improved Steam Deck-ishness of this Switch 2 is slotting right into my recent handheld gaming habits. I can\\'t wait to try more when it arrives June 5.',\n",

       " {'title': 'Box Office: ‘Minecraft’ Is Already the Highest-Grossing Domestic Release of 2025; Angel Studios’ ‘King of Kings’ Outdoing ‘The Amateur,’ ‘Drop’',\n",
       "  'publish_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 4, 12, 15, 22, 45, tzinfo=tzutc()),\n",
       "  'text': '“A Minecraft Movie” was assured to reign supreme at the domestic box office in its second weekend, but theaters are also getting buttressed with several more new releases, too. Of those, Angel Studios’ animated biblical film “The King of Kings” is leading the pack, heading for second place ahead of titles from major studios like “The Amateur” and “Drop.”\\n\\nAt the top of the charts, Warner Bros. and Legendary’s “A Minecraft Movie” keeps stacking blocks, notching another $20.5 million on Friday. The comedy adaptation of Mojang’s video game bestseller is expected to earn north of $80 million in its second frame, which would rank as the third-biggest weekend gross of the year behind its own smash $162 million opening and not far off from the $88 million debut of Disney’s “Captain America: Brave New World.” Talk about a block-buster.\\n\\nNow projecting a drop around 50%, “Minecraft” likely won’t match the superlative holds put up by titles like fellow video game adaptation “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” (a 36% second-weekend fall) or Warner’s other IP breakout “Barbie” (a 42% slide). But it’s impressive staying power nonetheless, demonstrating that “Minecraft” has crossed over beyond the property’s built-in fanbase that rushed to buy tickets on opening weekend. Plus, it only took seven days for “A Minecraft Movie” to surpass a $200 million domestic gross and solidify its status as the year’s top-grossing North American release. Now it’s just a matter of how high it can build.\\n\\nPopular on Variety\\n\\nEven with a PG-rated juggernaut topping the market, animated film “The King of Kings” is proving a competitive option for family audiences, landing in second place on domestic charts. The Korea-produced feature, a loose adaptation of Charles Dickens’ “The Life of Our Lord,” earned about $6.8 million across Friday and preview screenings from more than 3,200 locations. Angel is also offering a “Kids Go Free” initiative to boost attendance among families, allowing children no-cost admittance with the purchase of one adult ticket. Competitors now project the film is headed to an opening around $18 million.\\n\\nIf it overperforms a bit, it could even land the biggest opening ever for independent distributor Angel Studios, which last made a big splash with the R-rated human trafficking thriller “Sound of Freedom” in July 2023. That film debuted to $19 million before legging out a staggering $184 million domestic finish, outgrossing major Hollywood summer blockbusters like “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” and “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning.” In the two years since, Angel has been a more quiet, though still a regular presence in theaters, releasing modest dramas, often with a faith-based message. Their biggest hit after “Freedom” was last December’s apocalypse thriller “Homestead,” which earned $20 million domestic and featured an abrupt ending that teased a television sequel series for Angel’s streaming service.\\n\\nWith “King of Kings” outpacing traditional studio releases, the animated feature looks to become Angel’s second-biggest hit ever in just a few days, with an eye on next weekend’s Easter holiday to boost business. The film, which features the voice of Oscar Isaac as Jesus Christ and boasts other names like Pierce Brosnan, Mark Hamill, Forest Whitaker, Ben Kingsley, Kenneth Branagh and Uma Thurman, has so-so reviews. But Angel always resonates with its target audience; moviegoer survey firm Cinema Score’s pristine “A+” grade would indicate that they’ve done that again.\\n\\nOf the other new openings, “The Amateur” is drawing the biggest crowd, with the Rami Malek revenge thriller earning $6 million across Friday and preview screenings from 3,400 locations, now hoping for a three-day north of $15 million. The Disney release, under its 20th Century Studios banner, is sharing Imax and other premium large-format auditoriums with “Minecraft” and A24’s “Warfare” this weekend. Directed by James Hawes, the PG-13 vigilante film cost $60 million to produce and will have to stick around theaters to fully justify that price point. Reviews have been mixed, but audiences are more positive (a “B+” grade from Cinema Score).\\n\\nFourth and fifth are a tighter race, though the real-time Iraq thriller “Warfare” has the edge for now, earning about $3.5 million across Friday and preview screenings from 2,670 theaters, eyeing an $8 million debut. The R-rated military ensemble piece sees filmmaker Alex Garland reteam with A24 after both launched a breakout hit with “Civil War” a year ago. Co-directed by veteran Ray Mendoza, “Warfare” was a cheaper production than most studio films, though on the pricier side by A24 standards. The indie banner will hope to turn stellar reviews and great audience sentiment (an “A-” grade from Cinema Score) into a sustained theatrical run.\\n\\nUniversal’s modern suspense thriller “Drop” isn’t too far behind, earning $3.3 million across Friday and preview screenings from 3,085 locations, heading to a $7.7 million debut. The PG-13 Blumhouse production, which teams “White Lotus” breakout Meghann Fahy and “It Ends With Us” star Brandon Sklenar on a first date gone terribly wrong, cost $11 million to produce and will aim to buoy its box office with great reviews. Cinema Score turned in a more measured “B” grade among moviegoers for the Christopher Landon-directed feature.\\n\\nJust outside the top five, Fathom Events is bowing its third and final package of episodes for “The Chosen: Last Supper” this weekend. This bunch earned $2.5 million across Friday and previews. The specialty banner has broken up Season 5 of 5&2 Studios’ Biblical adaptation into three theatrical releases, with finale Episodes 7-8 coming this frame. The first two bundles, which debuted over the two weeks prior, have collectively earned more than $28 million so far.',\n",

       "  'text': 'NEW YORK (AP) — Lawyers for Sean “Diddy” Combs are urging a judge to let prospective jurors at the hip-hop mogul’s upcoming sex trafficking trial be questioned about their views regarding sex, drugs and violence.\\n\\nThe lawyers raised the subject as they submitted a proposed questionnaire to be filled out by individuals summoned for his May 5 trial in Manhattan federal court.\\n\\nIn a letter to a judge late Friday, the lawyers said they want to know the willingness of would-be jurors to watch videos that are sexually explicit or show physical assault. They also say they want to know their views toward people with multiple sexual partners.\\n\\nProsecutors in a letter of their own criticized the defense’s proposed questionnaire as too long and touching on subjects that would be better asked in person by the judge, if at all.\\n\\nThey said some of the defense’s proposed 72 questions, some containing subparts, were “utterly irrelevant to the ability to serve on a jury.”\\n\\nProsecutors also cited the sex trafficking trial of Ghislaine Maxwell as an example of how a lengthy questionnaire can be damaging.\\n\\nAfter Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking in December 2021, a juror admitted that he had failed to disclose that he was a sex abuse victim, blaming his oversight in part on being “distracted as he filled out the questionnaire” and having “skimmed way too fast,” causing him to misunderstand questions.\\n\\nJudge Arun Subramanian has told lawyers that questionnaires will be distributed to hundreds of prospective jurors at the end of April so that questioning of prospective jurors can begin on May 5, with opening statements likely on May 12.\\n\\nCombs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to allegations that he subjected individuals to sexual abuse over a two-decade period. The Bad Boy Records founder has remained incarcerated without bail since his September arrest.\\n\\nAn indictment accuses Combs of using the “power and prestige” he wielded as a music mogul to intimidate, threaten and lure women into his orbit, often under the pretense of a romantic relationship.\\n\\nThe indictment said he then used force, threats and coercion to cause victims, including three women specified in the court papers, to engage in commercial sex acts.\\n\\nIt said he subjected his victims to violence, threats of violence, threats of financial and reputational harm and verbal abuse.\\n\\nProsecutors have said that a key piece of the evidence at trial will be a video showing Combs punching his former protege and girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie, and throwing her on the floor in a hotel hallway.\\n\\nDefense lawyers have argued that prosecutors built their case on charges that try to demonize sex acts between consenting adults.\\n\\nThey told the judge they were unable to reach a consensus with prosecutors for what prospective jurors should be asked on questionnaires.\\n\\n“The defense believes it is important that we allow potential jurors to write candidly about the unprecedented and negative media attention that they may have been exposed to, related to Mr. Combs,” the lawyers wrote.\\n\\nDefense lawyers also asked that jurors be asked to tell if they’ve watched shows on television titled: “The Fall of Diddy,” “Diddy Do It?” “The Downfall of Diddy” and “Diddy: The Making of a Bad Boy.”',\n",

They are some of the most knowledgeable golf Patrons or spectators that we play in front of,” McIlroy told CNN after the round Saturday.\\n\\n“Yeah, look, it’s a pleasure to play in front of them and to have that atmosphere and that support. Tomorrow in that final group is going to be – it’s going to be a little rowdy and a little loud. I’m just going to have to settle in and really try to keep myself in my own little bubble and keep my head down and, you know, sort of approach tomorrow with the same attitude that I have tried to approach the last three days with.”\\n\\nRory McIlroy can become the sixth player to complete the modern career grand slam. David J.

I’m glad I have a short memory.”\\n\\nWhat followed was one of the most epic meltdowns tournament history as he limped back to the clubhouse in a tie for 15th place. It was one of the most heartbreaking collapses ever witnessed at Augusta National.\\n\\nA Sunday pairing for the ages\\n\\nMasters Sunday is setting up to be one to remember with McIlroy and DeChambeau fighting it out for the win.\\n\\nBut it didn’t always appear to be that way for the 31-year-old LIV Golfer.\\n\\nAfter two birdies to open the round, DeChambeau fell into a funk, bogeying three times over the next 10 holes to fall down the leaderboard.\\n\\nHowever, three birdies in the final four holes including an emphatic long birdie putt on the 18th hole that sent the crowd on hand into a frenzy and move him to 3-under 69 for the day and 10-under for the tournament.\\n\\nBryson DeChambeau after making a long birdie putt on the 18th hole of Augusta National to pull him within two shots of the lead.

They gave their reasons of who reminds them of who, debating and sometimes disagreeing.\\n\\nHere\\'s a look at some of their prospect-to-pro comparisons by position:\\n\\nQuarterbacks\\n\\nCathon said that as a pure quarterback, he would compare Jalen Milroe to Malik Willis. But looking for a comparison for a player who is \"dynamic\" and \"so explosive with the ball in his hands,\" he would go with Taysom Hill. Wilson noted that he has concerns about Milroe when it comes to pure pocket passing, but nobody can debate his elite athleticism.\\n\\nCarthon added that Milroe has the same deficiencies that Willis had, with their processing being a step off. Their strengths are also similar, being able to squeeze the ball into tight windows. Quarterbacks with lesser arm strength than them have to be a \"little more anticipatory,\" Carthon explained.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the Hill comparisons, the two are athletic and can do a lot with the ball in their hands. Milroe could find himself as a member of a quarterback room where he may not be the starter, but the team may work him into packages without forcing him into the game.\\n\\n\"In today\\'s game, I\\'m pretty sure you\\'re not going to have a guy with this type of ability just sitting on the sideline,\" Carthon said.\\n\\n\"I\\'m pretty high on him,\" Wilson began about Kyle McCord, getting some pushback from Carthon on the Kirk Cousins comparison.\\n\\nWhile Carthon agrees that McCord has grown over the years, he doesn\\'t agree with the take 100%, believing Cousins was a more \"natural passer,\" with the ball coming out quicker. Carthon compared McCord to Jeff Driskel, who has bounced around since entering the league in 2016.\\n\\nRunning backs\\n\\nCarthon compared TreVeyon Henderson to Chase Brown because they both excel in zone-running schemes and have the \"ability to be decisive and explosive,\" with their measurables also lining up. Wilson then predicted that Henderson would be one of the first running backs drafted this year.\\n\\nWilson called Omarion Hampton \"special,\" saying it would be a shock if he didn\\'t make it into the first round. Carthon agreed and added that his comparison is Joe Mixon. Carthon said they are \"two guys who are a load to bring down\" and \"two guys that are not shy when it comes to creating contact.\" Carthon added that both Mixon and Hampton excel in pass protection, too.\\n\\nCarthon said Jaydon Blue reminds him of Jahmyr Gibbs because of his explosiveness and ability to make an opposing player miss, saying the first defender never brings them down. On the right offense, Carthon can see Blue excelling in a third-down role, where he could be a problem catching passes in the backfield. Wilson added that there is no doubting how fast Blue is and said his comparison is James Cook.\\n\\n\"I can see that, just that smoothness and ability to glide and weave,\" Carthon said, responding to the Cook comparison.\\n\\nWilson called Brashard Smith \"electric\" and Carthon added that he is a \"big, big fan.\" With Smith transitioning to running back from wide receiver, Carthon said he will only get better, as this is still a new position for him. Once he has time to learn the nuances of reading and understanding defenses, he will reach even higher potential. Carthon predicted that Smith could even find himself being used as a kick returner.\\n\\nWide receivers\\n\\nIn terms of his size, ability to play down the field and to make guys miss, Wilson said Matthew Golden reminds him of Jordan Addison. Carthon, meanwhile, sees Golden as a first-round pick and would like to see him on an offense that already has a No. 1 receiver to play opposite of him.\\n\\nWhile Wilson admitted that he \"almost certainly\" doesn\\'t think Isaac TeSlaa will be Cooper Kupp at the next level, the size and being a big target in the middle of the field were his reasons for the comparison. In terms of not necessarily testing well but being used as necessary, Wilson made a second comp to Jauan Jennings.\\n\\nDefensive backs\\n\\nCarthon\\'s comparison: Micah Hyde (fifth round pick, retired)\\n\\nWilson called Malachi Moore one of \"the smartest kids in this draft.\" Carthon chimed in with his comparison to the former Pro Bowler Micah Hyde, explaining that they are both \"instinctive\" and \"above-average athletes\" with similar measurables.\\n\\nWilson\\'s comparisons: Javon Bullard (second-round pick, current team: Green Bay Packers) and Brian Branch (second-round pick, current team: Detroit Lions)\\n\\nWilson said he was \"ready to run through a wall\" while watching Jahdae Barron\\'s tape, emphasizing his enthusiasm for the game and comparing him to Javon Bullard and Brian Branch. Wilson said Barron is a \"locker room guy\" and knows exactly where he needs to be on the field. Barron has grown on Carthon, the former GM admitted, noting a team could move him around. On the field, Barron is \"a true matchup guy,\" Carthon added.',\n",

       "  'publish_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 4, 12, 0, 0),\n",
       "  'text': 'Jaron Ennis promised a moment. On Saturday night, he delivered one that will resound for years in a weight class in search of a spark.\\n\\nThe undefeated 27-year-old from Philadelphia who goes by Boots put on a blistering display at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, overwhelming Eimantas Stanionis with speed, sharpness and a full arsenal of punches en route to a sixth-round technical knockout. The win not only unified the IBF and WBA welterweight titles, but confirmed Ennis as the new face of a fractured division left adrift since Terence Crawford dismantled Errol Spence Jr nearly two years ago.\\n\\nStanionis, a tough and durable 30-year-old Lithuanian, had never been down in his professional career. But after being systematically broken down by the halfway point of the scheduled 12 rounds – his nose bloodied, his body battered, his rhythm disrupted – he never made it out for the seventh. His trainer, Marvin Somodio, waved it off from the corner after his fighter was dropped by a vicious combination to the body late in the sixth.\\n\\n“I had a dream I was going to stop him like that,” Ennis said in the ring afterward. “And it came true.”\\n\\nIt was more than just a win. It was a statement. Ennis (35-0, 30 KOs), long viewed as the heir to 147lb, had lacked the signature performance that would solidify his standing. A flat decision win over Karen Chukhadzhian last year raised more questions than answers. And after declining a chance to fight Vergil Ortiz Jr at 154lb, critics wondered whether the man once billed as the bogeyman of the division was pulling punches with his matchmaking. No one’s wondering anymore.\\n\\nFrom the outset, Ennis controlled the ring with poise and menace. He used his jab to set traps, stifled Stanionis’s forward momentum with clean counters, and switched stances with seamless fluency. By round four, he was targeting the body with increasing intent. In the fifth, he landed a fight-high 19 punches, 16 of them power shots, according to Compubox’s punch statistics. Stanionis had his moments, including two sharp overhand rights in the third, but Ennis simply absorbed and adjusted.\\n\\nThe sixth was the breaking point. After digging to the body with a series of thudding lefts, Ennis uncorked a flurry of blows that sent Stanionis down to one knee. Though he managed to beat the count and made it to the bell, the damage was done.\\n\\nSomodio opted to protect his fighter from further punishment – a call that felt merciful to some, premature to others. Ennis, meanwhile, strutted to his corner at the end of the round, staring down his opponent in a moment of complete control. The seventh round never came.\\n\\n“When I fight top-of-the-line guys, you see a different me,” Ennis said. “When I’m fighting for something, it’s a whole different story. Can’t nobody mess with me.”\\n\\nThe stoppage gave Ennis his fourth successful title defense and extended his unbeaten record to 35 wins in 35 fights, all but four ending inside the distance. It also marked the most significant welterweight bout since Crawford v Spence and arguably the most important result in the post-Crawford era. Mario Barrios, who owns the WBC’s version of the 147lb title, and Brian Norman Jr, who holds the WBO strap, remain in the mix, but neither has proven themselves at this level. On Saturday night, Ennis and Stanionis were clearly No 1 and 2 – and only one of them looked the part.\\n\\nThe setting, too, held meaning. Boardwalk Hall hadn’t played host to a major title fight since Sergey Kovalev beat down Bernard Hopkins in 2014. Atlantic City, once America’s east coast capital of championship boxing, has long been overshadowed by Las Vegas, New York and now Saudi Arabia. But with about 10,000 fans roaring and Philadelphia 76ers star Tyrese Maxey walking Ennis to the ring, it felt like a throwback to a different era, where a fighter could become a star on the strength of performance alone.\\n\\n“What’s crazy is that I had a dream I was going to stop him just like this,” Ennis repeated. “And it came true.”\\n\\nThe performance also gave Philly something to rally behind. Ennis, who grew up in the Germantown section of the city and picked up the nickname Boots as a kid tagging along to his father’s gym, has now outgrown the label of rising prospect. This was not a win that hinted at potential. It was a coronation.\\n\\nStanionis, a 2016 Olympian beaten for the first time in 16 professional fights, had come in with pedigree of his own, having been elevated to full WBA champion after Crawford vacated the title. He came forward with purpose and tried to make it a physical fight – but lacked the hand speed, angles or offensive variety to do real damage. By round six, his body language told the story.\\n\\nFor Ennis, the next move remains uncertain. He hasn’t ruled out a jump to 154lb, but with two of the four major welterweight belts now in hand, Ennis may want to pursue undisputed status before the scale catches up to him.\\n\\n“I’ll talk to my team,” he said when asked about his future. “But right now, I just want to enjoy this moment.”\\n\\nAnd enjoy it he should. After years of being labeled the next big thing, Ennis finally showed he’s no longer the future of the division. He’s its present.',\n",

       "  'text': 'This article has been reviewed according to Science X\\'s editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content\\'s credibility:\\n\\nA digital representation of neurons in a section of a mouse\\'s brain, part of a project to create the largest map to date of brain wiring and function, in Seattle, Wash. Credit: Forrest Collman/Allen Institute\\n\\nThis week, researchers reported a brain circuit linked to the intensity of political behavior. Microbiologists found that the 2018 eruption of the Kīlauea volcano drove a rare, massive summertime phytoplankton bloom, the largest ever recorded in the North Pacific. And a physics professor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville proposed a new model of the universe built on multiple singularities rather than a single Big Bang.\\n\\nAdditionally, a huge, quasiperiodic black hole flare is prompting a rethink about models of black hole behavior; scientists have made the most detailed functional map of a brain to date; and anthropologists propose that the transition to bipedal movement deeply influenced human thinking, musicality and communication:\\n\\nBoring galaxy interesting, actually\\n\\nIn 2019, a boring galaxy that nobody cared about 300 million light-years away started producing flashes of X-ray light in a clear bid for attention. Rolling their eyes in a theatrical, passive-aggressive display, astronomers said, \"FINE\" and aimed the Swift telescope at it but didn\\'t find anything unusual.\\n\\nBut in February 2024, SDSS1335+0728 flared up again with bursts of X-ray emissions at regular intervals, an example of seldom-observed quasiperiodic eruptions, in which a supermassive black hole wakes up from a long period of dormancy and has a kind of tantrum, probably because a small astronomical object like a star, planet or a smaller black hole is interacting with its rapidly spinning accretion disk. The black hole at the center of this unremarkable galaxy is now called Ansky.\\n\\nJoheen Chakraborty, a Ph.D. student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said, \"The bursts of X-rays from Ansky are 10 times longer and 10 times more luminous than what we see from a typical QPE.\" The astronomers say this indicates that current models of quasiperiodic eruptions may need revisiting. Ansky\\'s current series of eruptions could represent a different phenomenon, such as gravity waves interacting with the accretion disk.\\n\\nMouse takes red pill\\n\\nBiologists at Baylor College of Medicine have published the largest functional map of a brain ever made, comprising about 84,000 neurons in a region of a mouse\\'s visual cortex about the size of a poppy seed. Despite the tiny sample area of the mouse brain, the researchers note that the map\\'s stunning complexity resembles a map of cosmological filaments.\\n\\nThe 3D reconstruction, colored to delineate different brain connections, is the result of an experiment in which the researchers showed a mouse snippets of video, including sports, animation and scenes from \"The Matrix.\" The mouse was engineered with a gene that makes its neurons luminous when activated, and the researchers used a laser-powered microscope to record the activation of individual cells in the mouse\\'s visual cortex as it watched the video images. Afterward, they shaved that tiny piece of brain into 25,000 ultra-thin sections, taking 100 million high-resolution images to reconstruct the neural connections in 3D.\\n\\nScientists at Princeton University used AI to trace the filaments in the model and render the connections in different colors so they could be individually identified. Ultimately, the goal is to achieve a complete map of an entire mouse brain.\\n\\nSo I guess there\\'s a long way to go before I can nondestructively compile a complete functional model of my own brain, which (judging from my physical brain) would do absolutely nothing but remind me of embarrassing and humiliating things I did at parties and repeatedly play the KARS-4-KIDS song.\\n\\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

In fact, they suggest that the transition from walking on four legs to two legs may have influenced creativity along with changes to thinking and communication.\\n\\nDean Falk, professor of anthropology at Florida State University, says, \"Bipedal footsteps create rhythmic and more predictable sounds of movement, in comparison with the way in which our closest living relative, the chimpanzee, moves on all fours, with irregular steps among rustling tree branches.\" Human walking pace is about 120 steps per minute, the same tempo as many pieces of music.\\n\\nThey suggest that human baby talk arose as a substitute for physical contact with children—when humans began walking upright, small offspring could no longer cling to their parent\\'s fur to maintain body contact. The special musicality of baby talk could have arisen to maintain contact between adults and children. \"This may have stimulated the evolution of music and language,\" says co-author Matz Larsson.\\n\\n© 2025 Science X Network',\n",

But during his Senate confirmation last week, he explicitly distanced himself from the CEO.\\n\\nMusk’s comments Friday mark yet another split between him and the Trump administration over policy.\\n\\nThe billionaire is still fresh off a very public hissy fight about tariffs with Trump’s trade adviser, Peter Navarro.\\n\\nThe name-calling began last weekend and carried on into the week. Navarro, one of the architects of the president’s controversial tariffs, kicked it all off by slighting Musk, who has publicly come out against levies on foreign goods.\\n\\nNavarro called him a “car assembler” rather than a “car manufacturer”—adding that Musk “wants the cheap foreign parts.”\\n\\nThe Tesla CEO quickly fired back, calling Navarro “dumber than a sack of bricks” and “Peter Retarrdo” on separate occasions.\\n\\n*Peter Retarrdo — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 8, 2025\\n\\nAccording to The Guardian, Musk also attempted to convince Trump to ease up on his tariffs.\\n\\nAnd with reports that Musk might soon be stepping down from his position at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the relationship between the billionaire and the president seems to be on thin ice.\\n\\nYet the administration has avoided acknowledging the recent rift. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt brushed off the Musk-Navarro feud Tuesday, insisting that “boys will be boys.”\\n\\nTrump also continued to praise Musk’s work with DOGE during Thursday’s Cabinet meeting, saying: “Your people are fantastic. Hopefully they will stay around for the long haul, we’d like to keep as many as we can.”\\n\\nAccording to a NASA spokesperson, the agency has “begun the deliberative process” after reviewing the 2026 budget proposal, said Politico.\\n\\nThey declined to comment on Musk’s recent remarks and further details about the budget.',\n",

Daisy Hildebrand is the second unvaccinated girl from the community to die from measles in two months. Officials in Seminole town also joined the reception after her funeral to support the family, said South Plains Public Health Director Zach Holbrooks. This time, there was no talk of the vaccine that prevents measles deaths - unlike many of his long days since the outbreak began. \"The focus was on their healing,\" Mr Holbrooks said. \"You never want to see anybody pass away, especially a child that young, from any kind of illness, because there is a prevention for it - the MMR vaccine.\" Like other Seminole natives, Mr Holbrooks was not vaccinated against measles as a child. He got a shot in college, and another in February, when his hometown became the epicentre of one of the country\\'s worst measles outbreaks in a decade. The US has seen more than 700 cases this year, a sharp rise on the 285 cases reported in 2024. The majority of infections - 541 as of Friday - occurred in western Texas, with 56 patients sent to the hospital. Cases in New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas also are linked to the outbreak.

They try to reach vaccine-hesitant residents, but struggle with those who carry on with daily life as usual, alongside mixed messaging from federal officials, including Kennedy, who has endorsed immunisation conspiracy theories in the past. \"I wish there were more coming in to get the vaccine,\" Mr Holbrooks said. \"We can put messaging out, but it\\'s up to them to come see us.\"\\n\\nThe South Plains public health director, Zach Holbrooks, is trying to reach vaccine-hesitant communities through messaging and public advertisements\\n\\n\\'Going about\\' life in a measles epicentre\\n\\nThe western Texas town of Seminole - population 7,000 - is bordered by miles of rural farmland and oil fields. Among billboards for restaurants, gun silencers and tractors, a digital sign hints at the crisis gripping the community: a warning about the dangers of measles, which can cause complications including pneumonia, brain swelling and death. It has spread rapidly among Mennonites, a religious community living near Seminole. Mr Holbrooks estimates the population could be as many as 40,000 across several counties. In those areas, public school vaccination rates are as low as 82%. Roughly 95% of a community must be vaccinated against the measles to achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease that its spread is limited and the unvaccinated are protected. Mr Holbrooks remembers when the Low German Mennonite group began migrating to his hometown and nearby states in the 1970s. The religion has no specific doctrines against vaccinations, but they tend to avoid many modern aspects of life, including the health care system. Their community is not alone. At least 118,000 kindergarteners in Texas are exempt from one or more vaccines, mostly in rural areas, according to Terri Burke, director of Texas vaccine advocacy group the Immunization Partnership. Parents can get a waiver to exempt their child from school vaccine requirements for a variety of reasons, including religion. Savannah Knelsen, an 18-year-old server at a Seminole barbecue restaurant, has not been vaccinated against measles - or anything else.\\n\\nLike many in Seminole, Jessica Giesbrecht (left) and Savannah Knelsen (right) have opposing views on vaccination\\n\\nMany of her family members and friends - also unvaccinated - caught the measles in recent weeks. One relative developed a fever of 104.5F (40.2C), but still chose not to go to the hospital. The recent deaths of two children have not convinced her to get vaccinated, she said, adding that she was healthy and wanted to let her body \"fight off\" infections. Experts agree the vaccine is the best way to prevent infections - including severe ones. Ms Knelsen\\'s 19-year-old co-worker, Jessica Giesbrecht, along with her family, has been vaccinated against the measles. \"I\\'m worried for my baby niece,\" Ms Giesbrecht said, adding that she was too young to be vaccinated. Still, the two said the outbreak doesn\\'t weigh heavily on daily life. Others in Seminole agree. A cashier at a local pharmacy said no one has stopped by for measles vaccinations since the outbreak started. \"People are just going about their lives,\" she said.\\n\\nTexas has had over 500 cases of measles, most concentrated in rural western counties\\n\\nKennedy tries to \\'cover middle ground\\'\\n\\nOn Sunday, Kennedy made his first trip to the region since the outbreak to attend the eight-year-old girl\\'s funeral. The top US health official is an unlikely figure to spearhead the fight against measles - having in the past endorsed conspiracy theories about immunisation, including debunked claims about links to autism. He downplayed the outbreak in western Texas at first, calling it \"not unusual\". Trump echoed these remarks last weekend, saying that only a \"fairly small number of people\" had been impacted, when he was asked about it by the BBC aboard Air Force One. It was \"not something new\", he added. On Wednesday, Kennedy gave his strongest statement yet in support of the measles vaccine, telling the BBC\\'s US partner CBS News: \"The federal government\\'s position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine.\" The remarks were met with social media backlash from some anti-vaccine supporters. Kennedy added, however, that the government \"should not be mandating\" vaccines. The influence of some of his earlier remarks lingers. In one of several Mennonite-owned natural-health stores in Seminole, dozens of bottles of cod liver oil - a supplement that contains vitamin A - are on display. Alongside the vaccine, Kennedy has promoted vitamin A as an alternative measles treatment, a remedy doctors say should not be given without guidance from a physician and is no substitute for the vaccine.\\n\\nVitamin A is sometimes used to help treat measles - but should not be given without a physician\\'s guidance\\n\\nThe treatment has at times proven dangerous. Covenant Children\\'s Hospital in nearby Lubbock told the BBC it has treated several unvaccinated children with measles for vitamin A toxicity - some had attempted to use it as a preventative measure. The community needs federal officials to provide stronger messaging to help convince people to get vaccinated and slow the outbreak, said Gordon Mattimoe, director of the health department in nearby Andrews County. \"People look to their leaders to lead,\" he said. Jeff Hutt, a former spokesperson for the Make America Healthy Again political action committee and Kennedy\\'s former national field director, argued that the health secretary had to \"cover the middle ground\", providing statements that are \"politically adequate\" while also providing sceptical stances on vaccines. \"In covering the middle ground, I\\'m not necessarily sure he was able to reassure folks that he had a handle on [measles], or that he was able to reassure folks that he was sticking to his guns,\" Mr Hutt said.\\n\\nSlashing funds in an outbreak zone\\n\\nThe Trump administration\\'s health policies could have other consequences in Texas, officials say. Local health departments are at risk of losing critical resources because of attempts to cut $11.4bn (£8.8bn) in public health grants. The move was temporarily blocked by a judge last week. Mr Mattimoe said that because of the potential cuts - around $250,000 in grant funding for his health department - he is not able to hire a new nurse to give immunisations. In a statement to the BBC, the US Department of Health and Human Services said it had deployed the \"necessary\" resources from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to respond to the outbreak. \"The CDC is in close, constant communication with local and state health officials on the ground to ensure they have what they need,\" the official said. The Texas Department of Health Services could lose as much as $550m in grant funding. It has provided staff, vaccines, testing and other support to local health departments, but likely will need extra funding, spokesman Chris Van Deusen told the BBC. Mr Mattimoe contacted lawmakers and the state for help, but is not hopeful. \"I don\\'t think they have the funds,\" he said.\\n\\n\\'Trusted messengers\\'\\n\\nLocal officials have seen some success in measles vaccination clinics, but hope even more will get vaccinated',\n",

       "  'text': 'Summary: A new study has found that delusions typically emerge before hallucinations in individuals at high risk for psychosis, overturning a long-standing belief that hallucinations drive delusional thinking. By analyzing symptom progression across three large cohorts, researchers consistently observed that delusions were the earliest symptom, reappearing even before hallucinations during relapses.\\n\\nThe study suggests that disruptions in how the brain processes prediction errors may underlie delusions, with hallucinations emerging as a secondary effect. These insights may lead to earlier intervention strategies and better prevention of full-blown psychotic disorders.\\n\\nKey Facts:\\n\\nSymptom Onset: Delusions often appear before hallucinations in early psychosis.\\n\\nDelusions often appear before hallucinations in early psychosis. Predictive Processing: Psychosis may stem from the brain misinterpreting prediction errors, leading to distorted beliefs.\\n\\nPsychosis may stem from the brain misinterpreting prediction errors, leading to distorted beliefs. Prevention Potential: Understanding symptom progression opens the door to preventive treatments targeting brain hyperexcitability.\\n\\nSource: Yale\\n\\nPatients with psychosis have a disrupted connection to reality, often suffering from delusions and hallucinations. These symptoms have been thought to arise from the same brain processes, but a new Yale study upends this long-held belief.\\n\\nThe new study examined the natural progression of delusions and hallucinations in two large groups of adolescents and young adults in the earliest stages of psychosis—that is, individuals who experience these symptoms but not at the severity typically seen in fully-formed psychosis.\\n\\nTo see whether their findings were also observed in those who did develop the disease, the researchers also included a sample of individuals experiencing their first episode of psychosis.\\n\\nAcross these groups, the authors observed a consistent pattern in which delusions appeared before hallucinations. Even more striking, this same pattern was seen when symptoms disappeared and came back: Delusions re-emerged before hallucinations.\\n\\nThe findings of this study were recently published in Biological Psychiatry.\\n\\n“We were interested in understanding how delusions and hallucinations start and develop over time, because that could give us important hints as to where these symptoms come from in the first place,” says Albert Powers, MD, PhD, associate professor of psychiatry and the study’s senior author.\\n\\n“We looked at what we call the prodromal stage, when symptoms are just beginning to emerge. No one has been able to examine symptom emergence in so many people this early in the illness.”\\n\\nWhat are delusions and hallucinations?\\n\\nDelusions and hallucinations both disrupt a person’s perception of reality, but they are distinct symptoms of psychosis. Delusions are fixed, often bizarre beliefs that persist despite clear contradictory evidence.\\n\\n“For example, a person might believe they are the devil,” explains Powers. “And there is very little you could say to convince them otherwise.”\\n\\nHallucinations, on the other hand, involve perceiving things that aren’t actually present in the environment.\\n\\n“There’s nothing around you, and yet you see or hear it,” Powers explains.\\n\\nMost research has studied delusions and hallucinations once they are fully formed. However, these symptoms often unfold gradually over time, over an average of 22 months.\\n\\nDelusions may begin subtly, with a growing sense of suspicion or unease. Similarly, hallucinations might first appear as heightened sensations or vague sounds like static or indistinct murmurs, which can eventually develop into clearly perceived voices.\\n\\nThis slow progression ultimately culminates in the onset of psychosis in around 20% of those presenting these early symptoms.\\n\\nPowers recalls that during his medical training, delusions and hallucinations were typically treated as a single category, largely because they often responded to the same medications.\\n\\nWhen they were considered separately, it was often hypothesized that delusions may develop as an attempt to make sense of hallucinations. For instance, if someone hears the sound of footsteps behind them, they might come to believe that FBI agents are following them.\\n\\n“You might expect that hallucinations would come first because they create a need for explanation,” says Powers.\\n\\n“Why do I keep hearing people behind me all the time? Well, it’s because someone is after me.”\\n\\nWhile that hypothesis seems intuitive, the new study reveals a surprising twist: Delusions typically emerge before hallucinations.\\n\\nIn psychosis, delusions most often arise before hallucinations\\n\\nIn their new study, the researchers analyzed data from three large cohorts. Two of the datasets came from the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study, which consisted of individuals identified as being at high risk for developing psychosis.\\n\\nThe third dataset was drawn from the Montreal-based Prevention Program for Psychosis, which included participants experiencing their first psychotic episode.\\n\\n“When people enrolled in these studies, clinicians assessed their symptoms—how severe they were, when they started, and how often they happened,” says Powers.\\n\\n“But until now, no one had systematically examined which symptoms were most likely to start first.”\\n\\nAcross all three datasets, researchers found that most participants experienced both early delusions and hallucinations. However, among those who presented only one symptom, delusions were more common. Furthermore, individuals who experienced both were more likely to report that delusions appeared before hallucinations.\\n\\nThe study also followed symptom changes during periods of remission. Interestingly, the pattern appeared to reverse—participants typically experienced the disappearance of hallucinations before delusions. Then, if their symptoms reemerged, patients were once again more likely to report that delusions emerged before hallucinations.\\n\\nHallucinations may be the brain’s attempt to compensate for drivers of delusions\\n\\nWhile these findings may seem surprising, they fit with a set of emerging theories in psychiatry based on computational neuroscience. These theories suggest that delusions may arise from disruptions in how people learn about the world. This process centered on what is known as “predictive processing.”\\n\\nWhen a person experiences something that doesn’t match their expectations about the world, this prompts the brain to revise its expectations—it learns. For example, as a person arrives at work, they might expect their computer to turn on, as it does each morning. If one day the screen fails to light up, this is a violation of their expectation—a prediction error.\\n\\n“When a prediction that you have about the world is violated, this tells your brain to form a new belief or update its current beliefs about what is going on in the world,” says Powers.\\n\\n“This helps us keep up with the world and predict what’s going on around us. Predictions and prediction errors drive that process.”\\n\\nIn the earlier example, the person at work might form a new belief that their computer is dysfunctional or unplugged, leading them to check the power or consider taking it in for repairs.\\n\\nIn individuals with psychosis, dysfunction in one of the brain’s neurotransmitter systems can lead to hyperexcitability of the cerebral cortex, which could inject noise into the system.\\n\\nThis, in turn, could drive inappropriate learning via prediction errors not tied to a new state of the world, but to this noisiness. This would then lead to the formation of beliefs that don’t conform to reality, or delusions.\\n\\nFor example, a person might misinterpret an insignificant or coincidental event, such as witnessing two people conversing, as something new and more personally significant, like believing they are secretly talking about the person.\\n\\nAs prediction errors become excessive, individuals might begin to distrust the information they’re receiving from the world around them because it is tainted with noise. Hallucinations can arise when individuals begin trusting their expectations more than incoming sensory information—and thus start perceiving things that aren’t actually there.\\n\\n“This disconnect would cause them to conclude that something is around them, even though the sensory information doesn’t say it is,” Powers explains.\\n\\nIn this way, the noise that drives delusion formation could also make the brain distrust new information after some time, leading to hallucinations.\\n\\nResearch could lead to psychosis prevention\\n\\nBy studying how psychotic symptoms form and evolve, Powers hopes psychiatrists can move toward preventing psychosis, rather than just managing it once it appears. Current treatments primarily target symptoms without addressing the underlying mechanisms.\\n\\n“When you go to a psychiatrist, we focus on alleviating symptoms that cause problems in your life,” Powers says. “In the future, we want to stop the process that leads to symptoms in the first place.”\\n\\nHe points to cardiology as a model: Cardiologists treat heart attacks but also work to prevent them by addressing the root causes, such as high cholesterol or hypertension.\\n\\nPsychiatry, he says, lacks comparable preventative tools—but he envisions that changing. If hyperexcitability in the cerebral cortex is indeed driving delusions and hallucinations, then it may be possible to intervene earlier, before psychosis takes hold.\\n\\n“And there are drugs that do this,” says Powers. “They’re experimental right now, but they manage to decrease hyperexcitability of the cortex.”\\n\\nResearchers are currently testing whether these medications can effectively treat early signs of psychosis.\\n\\nPowers believes that understanding how the brain misinterprets sensory data has implications far beyond psychosis.\\n\\n“This is one of the first glimpses at what a pathophysiological model in psychiatry might look like,” he says.\\n\\n“Understanding how psychotic symptoms develop could help us understand how this could happen in other psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety, PTSD, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. All of these conditions affect the way we learn about the world and act upon it.”\\n\\nLooking ahead, his team plans to analyze electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance imaging data to try to identify biomarkers of psychosis. “Our next step is to study the actual brain data and see if we can catch the signatures of symptom emergence itself,” Powers says.\\n\\nFunding: This work was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health (awards R01MH129721 and R01MH131768).\\n\\nThe content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health.

Biological Psychiatry\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nEmergence and dynamics of delusions and hallucinations across stages in early psychosis\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nHallucinations and delusions are often grouped together within the positive symptoms of psychosis. However, recent evidence suggests they may be driven by distinct computational and neural mechanisms. Examining the time course of their emergence may provide insights into the relationship between these underlying mechanisms.\\n\\nMethods\\n\\nParticipants from the second (N = 719) and third (N = 699) iterations of the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS 2,3) were assessed for timing of CHR-P-level delusion and hallucination onset. Pre-onset symptom patterns in first-episode psychosis patients (FEP) from the Prevention and Early Intervention Program for Psychosis (PEPP-Montréal; N = 694) were also assessed. Symptom onset was determined at baseline assessment and the evolution of symptom patterns examined over 24 months.\\n\\nResults\\n\\nIn all three samples, participants were more likely to report the onset of attenuated/subthreshold delusions prior to attenuated/subthreshold hallucinations (odds ratios (OR): NAPLS 2=4.09; NAPLS 3=4.14; PEPP, Z=7.01, P < 0.001) and to present with only attenuated/subthreshold delusions compared to only attenuated/subthreshold hallucinations (OR: NAPLS 2=5.6; NAPLS 3=11.11; PEPP=42.75).\\n\\nRe-emergence of attenuated/subthreshold delusions after remission was also more common than re-emergence of attenuated/subthreshold hallucinations (Ps < 0.05), which more often resolved first (Ps < 0.001). In both CHR-P samples, ratings of delusional ideation fell with the onset of attenuated hallucinations (P = 0.007).\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nAttenuated/subthreshold delusions tend to emerge before attenuated/subthreshold hallucinations and may play a role in their development. Further work should examine the relationship between the mechanisms driving these symptoms and its utility for diagnosis and treatment.',\n",

       "  'publish_date': None,\n",
       "  'text': 'Indian pot belly: From status symbol to silent killer\\n\\n5 hours ago Share Save Soutik Biswas • @soutikBBC India correspondent Share Save\\n\\nGetty Images\\n\\nThe Indian pot belly - once a badge of prosperity, indulgence and aging respectability - has long been a target of satire and social commentary. In literature, it quietly signalled comfort or complacency; in films, it became a shorthand for the lazy official, gluttonous uncle, or a corrupt policeman. Cartoons exaggerated it to mock politicians. In rural settings, it was once considered a status symbol - a sign that \"this man eats well\". But what was once dismissed or even celebrated is now raising alarm bells. The obesity crisis in India is ballooning - and the seemingly harmless pot belly may be a far bigger villain than we think. India had the second-highest number of overweight or obese adults in 2021, with 180 million affected - behind only China. A new Lancet study warns this number could soar to 450 million by 2050, nearly a third of the country\\'s projected population. Globally, more than half of all adults and a third of children and adolescents are expected to face the same fate. At the heart of this issue in India lies the pot belly, or in medical terms, abdominal obesity. This form of obesity refers to the accumulation of excess fat around the belly and doctors say it\\'s more than a cosmetic concern. As far back as the 1990s, studies showed a clear link between belly fat and chronic conditions like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease.\\n\\nGetty Images By 2050, 450 million Indians are projected to be overweight or obese\\n\\nObesity isn\\'t just abdominal. It appears in different patterns, depending on fat distribution: peripheral obesity affects the hips, thighs, and buttocks, while generalised obesity involves fat spread more evenly across the body. The numbers on abdominal obesity in India are already troubling. According to the latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) - which, for the first time, measured waist and hip sizes - about 40% of women and 12% of men in India have abdominal obesity. Abdominal obesity, based on Indian guidelines, means a waist over 90cm (35 inches) for men and 80cm (31 inches) for women. Among women aged 30 to 49, nearly one in two already show signs of it. Urban populations were found to be more affected than rural ones, with high waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratios emerging as a key red flag. Indians are getting fatter - and it\\'s a big problem\\n\\nWhy are Indian children getting fatter? So why is belly fat such a big deal? One reason is insulin resistance - a condition where the body stops responding properly to insulin, the hormone that helps regulate blood sugar. Abdominal fat disrupts how the body uses insulin, making it harder to control blood sugar. Studies have found South Asians, including Indians, tend to have more body fat than white Caucasians at the same Body Mass Index. (BMI is a simple measure of body fat based on a person\\'s weight in relation to their height.) It\\'s not just how much fat you have - it\\'s where it goes. In South Asians, fat tends to collect around the trunk and under the skin, but not always deep in the abdomen as visceral fat. Though South Asians may have less of the more harmful deep abdominal fat around organs like the liver and pancreas, studies show their larger, less efficient fat cells struggle to store fat under the skin. As a result, excess fat spills into vital organs that regulate metabolism - like the liver and pancreas - raising the risk of diabetes and heart disease.\\n\\nReuters India, China, and the USA lead eight nations housing over half the world\\'s overweight and obese population\\n\\nScientists still don\\'t fully understand the biological reasons behind the fat distribution patterns. Though numerous genetic studies have been conducted, no single gene has consistently explained this tendency. One theory offers an evolutionary root. India, for centuries, was wracked by famines and chronic food shortages, leaving generations to survive on meagre nutrition. In such conditions, the human body adapted for survival in extreme scarcity. The body needed a depot for this energy and the abdomen, being the most expandable area, became the prime storage site. Over time, as food became more plentiful, this fat store continued to grow - eventually to harmful levels. \"It\\'s a conjectural but plausible evolutionary theory - one that can\\'t be proven, but makes sense,\" says Anoop Misra, who heads Delhi\\'s Fortis-C-DOC Centre of Excellence for Diabetes, Metabolic Diseases and Endocrinology. Last year, in a paper doctors belonging to the Indian Obesity Commission redefined obesity guidelines for Asian Indians, moving beyond BMI to better reflect how body fat relates to early health risks. They created a two-stage clinical system that considers fat distribution, related diseases and physical function. Stage one involves a high BMI, but without abdominal obesity, metabolic disease, or physical dysfunction. In such cases, lifestyle changes like diet, exercise and sometimes medication are usually enough. Stage two includes abdominal obesity - the harmful visceral fat - and is often accompanied by health issues like diabetes, knee pain or palpitations. This stage signals higher risk and calls for more intensive management.\\n\\nAFP Doctors blame rising belly fat in India on lifestyle shifts -junk food, takeout, instant meals',\n",
