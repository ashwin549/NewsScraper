       "  'text': 'A Washington Post editorial appeared earlier this week headlined “Trump’s efforts to intimidate the legal profession cannot stand.”\\n\\nWithin 48 hours later, those efforts were not merely standing. They had worked — at least in one case.\\n\\nThe major law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison (called Paul, Weiss), targeted by President Trump in an executive order, opted to mollify rather than confront the president. In short, it backed down.\\n\\nDemocrats, as well as many lawyers, are grappling with the implications.\\n\\nPaul, Weiss agreed to provide $40 million in pro bono work on causes backed by the administration and to hire an outside expert to audit its hiring and employment practices.\\n\\nAfter the firm had made those concessions, and some others, Trump agreed to lift an executive order that would have taken away security clearances from the law firm’s staff.\\n\\nOn social media, critics accuse the law firm of giving in to a “shakedown” or “extortion” by Trump.\\n\\nThe firm’s chair, Brad Karp, defended the deal he struck in an email to all employees, according to The New York Times.\\n\\nKarp reportedly argued he had merely “reaffirmed” the firm’s principles. Others have noted that the $40 million pro bono commitment amounts to only about one-fifth of the pro-bono work the massive firm typically does each year.\\n\\nThat being said, the appearance of appearing to bend the knee to Trump with such alacrity has caused widespread alarm in legal circles.\\n\\nProminent attorney Mark Zaid told this column that a “horrible message” was being sent both to the legal profession and to the public at large by Paul, Weiss’s “decision to simply capitulate in fear rather than stand up for the rule of law and the ethical principles that guide lawyers.”\\n\\nZaid, who is best known for defending whistleblowers of all political persuasions, had his own security clearance revoked by Trump recently. But he remains unbowed.\\n\\n“There are many of us,” he said, “who will not be bullied or intimidated, notwithstanding the continuing attacks on lawyers.”\\n\\nIn addition to the Paul, Weiss firm, other law firms have been targeted by Trump.\\n\\nThe most prominent in the firing line was Perkins Coie, the firm that represented the presidential campaign of 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nIn that capacity, it contracted another organization called Fusion GPS to do opposition research on Trump. Fusion GPS in turn sought the assistance of retired British spy Christopher Steele, who produced the now-infamous “Steele dossier.”\\n\\nThis history appears to have drawn the lasting enmity of Trump.\\n\\nBut Perkins Coie — unlike Paul, Weiss — has chosen to fight. It won an interim victory when U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell earlier this month froze parts of Trump’s executive order against the firm pending further hearings.\\n\\nOn Friday, Trump’s Department of Justice tried to get Howell thrown off the case, alleging that she had shown “partiality” against Trump.\\n\\nA third legal firm, Covington & Burling, was also the subject of a Trump targeting. It has so far navigated a lower profile, middle ground in which it is neither challenging the president so publicly as Perkins Coie, nor accommodating him like Paul, Weiss.\\n\\nFor all three legal firms — and for others eyeing these developments with alarm — there is a near-certainty that they would lose significant numbers of clients if they lose their security clearances. In the case of Perkins Coie, the Trump administration has signaled it will not do federal business with the firm’s clients — a massive pressure point that could call the firm’s existence into question.\\n\\nBut Democrats and other Trump critics worry about a broader attempt to squelch dissent.\\n\\nPart of that, to be sure, is concentrated in the legal sphere.\\n\\nTrump has called for the impeachment of the judge who ruled against him when his administration used the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants last weekend. Elon Musk referred to a separate adverse ruling — this one blocking a ban on openly transgender people serving in the military — as a “judicial coup.”\\n\\nTrump’s detractors also contend he is targeting the media. They cite the banishment of The Associated Press from the White House press pool for some events over a dispute about language and Trump’s suing of Paramount, the parent company of CBS News, over its editing of an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris last fall.\\n\\nDemocrats also fear an effort to use fringe actions, like violent attacks on Tesla vehicles and showrooms, as a pretext to go after organizations that help the party and liberal causes. Vice President Vance has suggested that the Tesla attacks are being funded by “very wealthy left-wing people” while online fundraising platform ActBlue has recently been targeted by Musk.\\n\\n“I think it’s shocking. But I also think it is something that the Democratic Party has to recognize,” veteran Democratic strategist Tad Devine said. “We are under assault.”\\n\\nDevine also contended that Democrats had to unite on a message.\\n\\nHe contended the message should be that Trump acts “not to take care of the people of this country but to take care of himself and his wealthy friends.”\\n\\nDemocrats, of course, have not yet united on any message.\\n\\nAnd whether they can find one that would stop the Trump juggernaut from rolling is another question entirely.\\n\\nThe Memo is a reported column by Niall Stanage.',\n",

       "  'text': '(NewsNation) — There are signs to be read in the volatile town hall meetings that some Republican members of Congress are facing and in the tour of swing districts that U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders is undertaking with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive activist argues.\\n\\nBoth are indications voters are rejecting President Donald Trump’s attempt to dismantle federal government through the efforts of billionaire Elon Musk, says Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.\\n\\n“We do a lot of polling. The economy is by far the highest on the list,” Green told “NewsNation Now” on Friday. “The idea that Donald Trump and Elon Musk are violating the Constitution in order to cut your Social Security, cut your Medicare, cut your Medicaid, cut your veterans’ benefits, in order to give Elon Musk a tax break, does very well.”\\n\\nGreen said the federal funding freezes imposed early in Trump’s second term alarmed voters to the extent that even conservatives are pushing back. He said the swing district rallies being held by progressives Sanders, I-Vt., and Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., are drawing people who likewise are alarmed.\\n\\n“They’re building muscle memory,” Green said of the latter events. “People aren’t just receiving a message. They’re going there and looking around and being like, ‘Oh, I’m with 1,500 people.’ In the future, when we ask them to come out into the streets, they’ll be like, ‘I won’t be alone.’”\\n\\nSome Democratic lawmakers also are facing hostile crowds in their home districts, with voters complaining they’re not doing enough to curb Trump’s actions.',\n",

       "  'text': \"SAN DIEGO (AP) — Lennon Tyler and her German fiancé often took road trips to Mexico when he vacationed in the United States since it was only a day’s drive from her home in Las Vegas, one of the perks of their long-distance relationship.\\n\\nBut things went terribly wrong when they drove back from Tijuana last month.\\n\\nU.S. border agents handcuffed Tyler, a U.S. citizen, and chained her to a bench, while her fiancé, Lucas Sielaff, was accused of violating the rules of his 90-day U.S. tourist permit, the couple said. Authorities later handcuffed and shackled Sielaff and sent him to a crowded U.S. immigration detention center. He spent 16 days locked up before being allowed to fly home to Germany.\\n\\nSince President Donald Trump took office, there have been other incidents of tourists like Sielaff being stopped at U.S. border crossings and held for weeks at U.S. immigration detention facilities before being allowed to fly home at their own expense.\\n\\nThey include another German tourist who was stopped at the Tijuana crossing on Jan. 25. Jessica Brösche spent over six weeks locked up, including over a week in solitary confinement, a friend said.\\n\\nOn the Canadian border, a backpacker from Wales spent nearly three weeks at a detention center before flying home this week. And a Canadian woman on a work visa detained at the Tijuana border spent 12 days in detention before returning home last weekend.\\n\\nREAD MORE: Canadians grapple with a sense of betrayal after Trump’s trade war and 51st state threats\\n\\nSielaff, 25, and the others say it was never made clear why they were taken into custody even after they offered to go home voluntarily.\\n\\nPedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee’s US-Mexico border program, a nonprofit that aids migrants, said in the 22 years he has worked on the border he’s never seen travelers from Western Europe and Canada, longtime U.S. allies, locked up like this.\\n\\n“It’s definitely unusual with these cases so close together, and the rationale for detaining these people doesn’t make sense,” he said. “It doesn’t justify the abhorrent treatment and conditions” they endured.\\n\\n“The only reason I see is there is a much more fervent anti-immigrant atmosphere,” Rios said.\\n\\nOf course, tourists from countries where the U.S. requires visas — many of them non-Western nations — have long encountered difficulties entering the U.S.\\n\\nU.S. authorities did not respond to a request from The Associated Press for figures on how many tourists have recently been held at detention facilities or explain why they weren’t simply denied entry.\\n\\nWeekslong lockups fuel anxieties about tourist travel to U.S.\\n\\nThe incidents are fueling anxiety as the Trump administration prepares for a ban on travelers from some countries. Noting the “evolving” federal travel policies, the University of California, Los Angeles sent a notice this week urging its foreign-born students and staff to consider the risks of travel for spring break, warning “re-entry requirements may change while you are away, impacting your return.”\\n\\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement said in an email to the AP that Sielaff and Brösche, who was held for 45 days, “were deemed inadmissible” by Customs and Border Protection. That agency said it cannot discuss specifics but “if statutes or visa terms are violated, travelers may be subject to detention and removal.” The agencies did not comment on the other cases.\\n\\nBoth German tourists were allowed into the United States under a program offered to a select group of countries, mostly in Europe and Asia, whose citizens are allowed to travel to the U.S. for business or leisure for up to 90 days without getting a visa in advance.

Where do you live?” Tyler said.\\n\\n“English is not Lucas’ first language and so he said, ‘We’re going to Las Vegas,’ and the agent says, ’Oh, we caught you. You live in Las Vegas. You can’t do that,'” Tyler said.\\n\\nSielaff was taken away for more questioning. Tyler said she asked to go with him or if he could get a translator and was told to be quiet, then taken out of her car and handcuffed and chained to a bench.

He said he was given a full-body search and ordered to hand over his cellphone and belongings. He was put in a holding cell where he slept on a bench for two days before being transferred to the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego.\\n\\nThere, he said, he shared a cell with eight others.\\n\\n“You are angry, you are sad, you don’t know when you can get out,” Sielaff said. “You just don’t get any answers from anybody.”\\n\\nHe was finally told to get a direct flight to Germany and submit a confirmation number.

She said she learned about Brösche from a TikTok video asking anyone in the San Diego area for help after her family learned she was being held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center. Paschen visited her several times and told her people were working to get her out.

The Israeli military said it had hit dozens of rocket launchers and a command centre belonging to Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia and political group, in southern Lebanon. Lebanon\\'s health ministry said two people, including a child, were killed and eight injured in the strikes. Hezbollah said it had not carried out the rocket attack into Israel. Lebanon said an investigation has been launched.\\n\\nSaturday\\'s attack came days after Israel reinforced its offensive against Hamas, a Hezbollah ally, in Gaza. The Israeli military said it had intercepted three rockets in the northern Israeli town of Metula, and there were no reports of casualties. The Lebanese military said it had dismantled \"three primitive rocket launchers\" in the south, and the country\\'s defence minister said an investigation had been launched into the attack. Hezbollah, the main armed group active in Lebanon, said it had not carried out the attack, and that it remained committed to the ceasefire that ended 14 months of conflict in Lebanon. This is the worst violence since the fragile ceasefire, brokered by the US and France, came into effect. Under the terms of the deal, the Lebanese military would deploy thousands of additional soldiers to the south of the country to prevent armed groups from attacking Israel. Hezbollah was required to remove its fighters and weapons, while the Israeli military would withdrawal from positions occupied in the war. But Israel has carried out nearly daily air strikes on what it describes as Hezbollah targets, and has indicated that attacks will continue to prevent the group from rearming.',\n",

       "  'text': 'As it unfurls, the saga of Mahmoud Khalilâ\\x80\\x94the Columbia agitator picked up by immigration enforcement last weekâ\\x80\\x94looks less like a complicated immigration-law dispute and more like something out of a John le CarrÃ© novel.\\n\\nBut inspect the details, and Khalilâ\\x80\\x99s case gives us a glimpse a well-established network linking American universities, international progressive NGOs, and government agencies. This network places ideologues like Khalil in positions of power and influence and promoting radical policies that challenge both the will of American voters and our national-security interests.\\n\\nFinally, a reason to check your email. Sign up for our free newsletter today.\\n\\nAs always in such shady tales, the simplest questions are the hardest to answer. To start: Who, exactly, is Mahmoud Khalil? According to the Guardian, he was born in Syria in 1995 to Palestinian refugees, then fled at 18 to settle in Lebanon. After his detention, however, the U.S. government reported that he was a citizen of Algeria. How did he end up there?\\n\\nHis professional history is equally convoluted. The Guardian claims he worked for various international NGOs, then landed a job with Britainâ\\x80\\x99s Foreign Office, where he helped administer the prestigious Chevening Scholarship program. (The Telegraph, to make an intricate story even more complicated, reported that Khalil worked for the embassy, not the Foreign Office per se). Then it was on to the UN, where Khalil interned for UNRWAâ\\x80\\x94the organizationâ\\x80\\x99s agency for Arab Palestinian refugees that, as a recent lawsuit claims, is a major source of staffing and funding for Hamas. How did a Syrian refugee end up in these positions?\\n\\nMaybe the influencers who gave him these jobs are the same ones who leapt to his defense. Immediately after his arrest, Khalilâ\\x80\\x99s case was taken on by no fewer than 19 lawyers.\\n\\nHeading Khalilâ\\x80\\x99s legal defense team is Ramzi Kassem, professor of law at the City University of New York, with a panoply of connections. Himself a Syrian immigrant, Kassem is a fellow of the Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans, which helped fund his legal education at Columbia University. At CUNY, Kassem founded Creating Law Enforcement Accountability and Responsibility (CLEAR), which, among other areas of interest, focused on challenging the Trump administrationâ\\x80\\x99s treatment of Muslims on the No Fly List. CLEAR has received major gifts from George Sorosâ\\x80\\x99s Open Society Foundations and Jeff Bezosâ\\x80\\x99s former wife, MacKenzie Scott.\\n\\nRamzi Kassem, attorney for Mahmoud Khalil, speaks after a hearing on March 12, 2025, in New York City. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\\n\\nKassemâ\\x80\\x99s previous clients include a few members of al Qaida, including Ahmed al-Darbi, a terrorist convicted in 2017 for bombing a French oil tanker, as well as another close associate of Osama Bin Ladenâ\\x80\\x99s. In 2022, the Biden administration nevertheless tapped Kassem to serve as a senior policy advisor.\\n\\nHow did Khalilâ\\x80\\x99s predicament come to Kassemâ\\x80\\x99s attention? Itâ\\x80\\x99s worth noting that while still a student at Columbia, Kassem was himself a leader of anti-Israeli agitation.\\n\\nSo was another of Khalilâ\\x80\\x99s lawyers, CLEARâ\\x80\\x99s Shezza Abboushi Dallal. In a recently surfaced video of an online training of anti-Israel activists, Dallal acknowledges that statements in support of Hamas may implicate a non-citizenâ\\x80\\x99s legal statusâ\\x80\\x94the very assertion that she and Khalilâ\\x80\\x99s other lawyers are now denyingâ\\x80\\x94and advises her charges to remain silent rather than frame themselves.\\n\\nShezza Abboushi Dallal, Staff Attorney with the Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility (CLEAR) Project, reads a statement from the wife of Mahmoud Khalil after a hearing on March 12, 2025, in New York City. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\\n\\nThereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing inherently nefarious about hardworking and talented people, immigrants or native-born, ending up in positions of power and influence. Nor is it novel for NGOs with deep pockets to promote their worldview and their people. But the Khalil case points at a concerted, long-term effort to capture American institutions, change them from within, and push policies and ideas that lie far outside the social consensus and, arguably, the boundaries permissible by law.\\n\\nRamzi Kassem is typical. He is committed to a long list of radical causes, from defanging law enforcement to defending Americaâ\\x80\\x99s sworn enemies. Nonetheless, he has enjoyed heavy support from progressive philanthropists, accreditation from Americaâ\\x80\\x99s finest schools, and eventually made his way to Washington to help reshape policy.\\n\\nSimilarly, it is troubling that those who argue, against all available evidence, that Mahmoud Khalil is a martyr on the altar of free speechâ\\x80\\x94rather than someone who violated the terms of his residency by advocating for a terror groupâ\\x80\\x94enjoy near-universal access to and support from our finest academic institutions, our best-endowed philanthropies, and our best-placed legal or political elites. Telling foreign nationals to refrain from espousing support for a terror group to evade legal trouble exceeds the bounds of advocacy; it approximates aiding and abetting people in skirting our immigration laws.\\n\\nIf nothing else, the Khalil case demonstrates yet again that for Americaâ\\x80\\x99s progressive elites, power, not principle, is the currency that counts, and that the system theyâ\\x80\\x99ve designed ensures that their power is preserved in perpetuity, defending even those fellow travelers who work to undermine our national-security interests. The only way to regain control of the institutions that these hostile activists have commandeered is to know their playbook and use the law to curb their influence. Shadowy activists subverting the will of the American people and then seeking protection from a bubble of big-money NGOs and ideologically aligned government officials isnâ\\x80\\x99t a safeguard protecting our democracy; itâ\\x80\\x99s a clear and direct threat to our national security and interests.\\n\\nTop Photo: Mahmoud Khalil talks to the press at Columbia University on June 01, 2024.

       "  'text': 'ALDIE, Va. (AP) — The room where President James Monroe crafted part of his famed doctrine exudes a quiet, stately atmosphere.\\n\\nInside the enclosed west porch a few footsteps away, a quarried-stone floor marked by fossilized dinosaur tracks glimmers in the sunlight. Just around the corner, a portico built by enslaved African Americans looks out over rolling foothills stretching into the misty northern Virginia horizon, a captivating view untarnished by monied property developments bellying up nearby.\\n\\nIt’s an early morning at Oak Hill, where centuries of history are deeply rooted in Monroe’s Loudoun County estate. It’s the last home of a presidential Founding Father still in private hands, according to conservation experts.\\n\\nThat is, maybe, until now.\\n\\nThe DeLashmutt family, which has owned Oak Hill in the community of Aldie since 1948, hopes to convert its sprawling 1,240 acres (502 hectares) into a state park. A bill to that effect unanimously passed the House of Delegates last month but failed in the Senate.\\n\\nThe DeLashmutts, along with a nonprofit corporation, The Conservation Fund, hope Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin will revive the multimillion-dollar project by including it in his proposed amendment to the budget bill ahead of the General Assembly’s veto session. The governor has until Monday to submit his revisions.\\n\\n“We’ve taken good care of it,” family matriarch Gayle DeLashmutt said, gazing up at trees in the garden during a recent tour of the grounds. “And I think it’s time to let somebody else do it.”\\n\\nA long history of family ownership\\n\\nThe DeLashmutt family, which is unrelated to the Monroes, is part of a long line of Virginians who have lived in Oak Hill. Other Founding Fathers’ homes in the state — Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello, George Washington’s Mount Vernon and Monroe’s Highland estate — are owned by educational and historical institutions that open the estates’ doors to the public.\\n\\nThe residence at Oak Hill has a complex heritage: At the top of a split staircase leading to the entrance sits a gifted bell from the decommissioned USS Oak Hill. Inside, elegant parlors feature fireplace mantelpieces made of decadent marble, a gift from Monroe’s longtime friend, the Marquis de LaFayette, to thank first lady Elizabeth Kortright Monroe for saving his wife from the guillotine. On an interior windowpane, a young man with the last name of Fairfax, a family that previously owned the house, scratched his name and the date of his graduation from the Virginia Military Institute.\\n\\nGayle DeLashmutt’s daughter, India DeLashmutt, grew up on the estate, charging about on go-carts and sledding down steep hills in the same place that Monroe hosted first lady Dolley Madison more than 100 years earlier. Her father used to tell her stories about finding arrowheads in Little River, a tributary that streams through the property.\\n\\n“There’s just this span of time, and this place can really represent it,” she said.\\n\\nHistories of enslaved residents and Indigenous generations\\n\\nThe estate also embodies the histories of the enslaved African Americans who built and cared for the property.\\n\\nThere is George Williams, an enslaved carpenter who constructed the main house in Oak Hill, according to independent researcher Emily Stanfill. And Natus Berryman, who lived at Oak Hill before being forced to move to the South, said Lori Kimball, another researcher.\\n\\nOpening the estate to the public full time would allow people to learn more about their stories, Kimball said.\\n\\nDonna Bohanan, chair of the Black History Committee at a Loudon County genealogical library, said it would also educate the public about the Indigenous people and tenant farmers who lived on and worked the land.\\n\\n“I advocate for not just focusing on the great men of history or military history because that leaves out a lot,” Bohanan said. “By telling our more inclusive stories, we can start to see the connections between all of us as members of the human race.”\\n\\nUncertain commitment from Virginia\\n\\nLoudoun County has allocated $22 million toward the roughly $52 million needed to support the project, while The Conservation Fund and other groups have raised another nearly $25 million. The family is selling the property for $20 million. The Conservation Fund says the state won’t have to pay a dime toward the project.\\n\\nThe legislation for such an acquisition, backed by Democratic Del. Alfonso Lopez, passed unanimously in the Virginia House last month but stalled in the state Senate. During the final days of the session, Democratic Sen. L. Louise Lucas told reporters that she thought the bill was an excellent idea but expressed concern about long-term commitments from the state, even if it has no upfront financial obligation.\\n\\n“That’s a lot of park for somebody to take care of,” she said. “Those are the kinds of things you have to consider when you’re working on these budgets.”\\n\\nYoungkin said Wednesday he was initially resistant to the project because he was not sure the business plan was fully fleshed out. But he said he felt less uneasy after touring the estate with Republican Del. Geary Higgins, whose district includes Oak Hill.\\n\\n“We had a good visit, and I’m still trying to decide what we do,” Youngkin said. “No promises, but I’m open-minded.”\\n\\n___\\n\\nOlivia Diaz is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Yet, Schroter said, how much leaders can ask of workers is often bound by \"how much they\\'re willing to follow you through a fire.\"\\n\\nHe said that for Musk, like Apple cofounder Steve Jobs, workers\\' loyalty is often high enough that employees will strive to meet tall expectations, including long hours.\\n\\n\"There\\'s only one Elon Musk,\" he said. \"This isn\\'t me fanboying him at all.

       "  'text': 'Printemps\\' new store is located in New York City\\'s Financial District. The store has creative merchandise displays, such as in its sneaker room.\\n\\nA piece of Paris has landed in New York City.\\n\\nFrench luxury retailer Printemps officially opened its first U.S. store this week in the city\\'s Financial District. The retailer celebrated its opening on Friday, which coincided with the start of spring — its namesake.\\n\\nThe 55,000-square-foot store spans two floors and carries a wide range of merchandise, including clothing, shoes, handbags, makeup and more. About 25% of its brands are either not available or rare in the U.S., such as the Joseph Duclos brand, a French luxury name that made a handbag sported by Taylor Swift, Printemps CEO Jean-Marc Bellaiche said.\\n\\nIn an interview with CNBC, Bellaiche said the retailer aims to stand out from other luxury players with the store\\'s eye-catching architecture; unique mix of popular luxury brands and hard-to-find French brands; and programming and services, which include beauty and spa treatments and clothing and accessory repairs.\\n\\nPrintemps Group was founded in 1865 and operates 20 department stores in France. Compared with its French stores, the U.S. location has more of an experiential bent, with rotating displays of merchandise resembling pop-up shops and food concepts, including a restaurant and a café with French pastries. Its playful design is inspired by a Parisian apartment, and it is located at One Wall Street, a historic Art Deco skyscraper.\\n\\nFor instance, one of the highlights of the Printemps store is the Red Room. The Art Deco-style room was decorated floor to ceiling with red and gold mosaics by master muralist Hildreth Meière and completed in 1931. It was previously a reception room and banking hall for the Irving Trust and Bank Company, and was designated an interior landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.\\n\\nPrintemps restored the room and turned it into a \"shoe forest\" where shoppers can browse for footwear or order a glass of wine at a nearby bar.\\n\\nThe store also will include Maison Passerelle, a fine dining restaurant steered by Gregory Gourdet, a two-time Top Chef finalist and three-time James Beard award winner. It will open in April.\\n\\nPrintemps is opening the U.S. store as luxury spending slows across the globe. Even some wealthier consumers have pulled back on discretionary purchases because of inflation and economic uncertainty. In China, a key market for higher-end goods, luxury spending has not bounced back to pre-pandemic levels.\\n\\nSales in the global luxury industry are projected to grow 1% to 3% annually through 2027, according to a report last month by consulting firm Kearney. The report attributed the slowdown to weaker demand among Chinese consumers, inflationary pressures in the U.S. and economic uncertainty fueled by trade disruptions and policy changes by the Trump administration.\\n\\nThat is a marked change from 2020 to 2021, when global luxury spending jumped about 27%, according to Kearney\\'s report. Global luxury spending across goods and services totaled an estimated $500 billion in 2024.\\n\\nStill, Brian Ehrig, one of the report\\'s authors and a partner in Kearney\\'s consumer practice, said the U.S. remains an attractive market for luxury brands because of consumers\\' resilience.\\n\\n\"On a relative basis, we have the healthiest economy, if you look at the major economies,\" he said. \"And then the other thing is, Americans love to shop.\"\\n\\nEhrig added that other high-end retailers have doubled down on investments in large and eye-catching physical stores, too, such as LVMH -owned Tiffany & Co. and Louis Vuitton opening new stores in New York City. He said the in-person experience is more critical in a sector where items come with such high price tags and expectations for personal service.\\n\\n\"There\\'s something special about being in a luxury retail store, about the way you\\'re taken care of and you\\'re made to feel like a VIP when you\\'re there,\" he said. \"And there\\'s just no way to do that online or on an iPhone.\"\\n\\nOther internationally based retailers with lower price points are expanding and opening more stores in the U.S., too, including Ireland-based Primark and Spain-based Mango.\\n\\nFor Printemps, the U.S. opportunity became clear, especially after the Covid-19 pandemic, as more Americans visited Paris and came to its stores, Bellaiche said. In terms of sales, Americans are the third-largest spenders for Printemps after the French and Chinese, he added. Yet, Americans are closing the gap, with sales to American customers tripling from 2019 and 2024, he said.\\n\\nEven with its luxury focus, Laura Lendrum, CEO of Printemps America, said the store mixes in more approachable items for tourists or aspirational shoppers who may stop by for a cup of coffee or browse for a $50 gift.\\n\\nHere\\'s a look inside the store:',\n",

       "  'text': 'Credit: Farknot Architect/Shutterstock\\n\\nMac users take note: A well-known (and relatively sophisticated) phishing scheme previously targeting Windows is now being redirected at macOS and Safari in an attempt to obtain login credentials (your Apple ID).\\n\\nOn Windows, this scam worked by displaying fake security alerts on compromised websites claiming that the user\\'s device had been \"compromised\" or locked\" at the same time that malicious code caused the website itself to freeze (making the scam more convincing). The notification prompted users to enter their Windows credentials to regain access—obviously handing them directly to the attackers to take over their accounts. Users were also advised to call a fake hotline, where they were pressured to pay a ransom or allow remote access to their machines.\\n\\nAccording to a post by LayerX Labs covering the scam, this attack was successful for over a year—in part because the alerts impersonated real Microsoft notifications so well, with sophisticated phishing sites hosted on a legitimate Microsoft domain (windows[.]net) and randomized subdomains that rotated frequently.\\n\\nHow this phishing campaign works on Mac\\n\\nAs 9to5Mac notes, the campaign quickly pivoted to targeting macOS and Safari after anti-scareware was released for Edge, Chrome, and Firefox in February. It works similarly with pages and text modified for Mac. You can be targeted on Safari if you mistype a URL while trying to access a legitimate website, after which you\\'ll be redirected through a compromised \"parking\" page to a phishing attack page. As with Windows, you may be prompted to enter your Apple credentials to fix the problem.\\n\\nLayerX Labs states that phishing campaigns targeting Mac \"have rarely reached this level of sophistication,\" though the screenshots of the security pop-ups included in the report contain spelling errors and don\\'t fit Apple\\'s style. As always, bring a critical eye to any communication or alerts that seem urgent or request sensitive information, as you\\'ll usually be able to spot such discrepancies.\\n\\nOtherwise, make sure you type in the correct URL for the sites you want to visit, or search for them on Google and scroll past the ads to the real results before clicking through.

       "  'publish_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 3, 21, 0, 0),\n",
       "  'text': 'Photographer Reuben Wu created a new project, Thin Places, using the brand-new Fujifilm GFX100RF. With the new 102-megapixel fixed-lens medium-format camera, Wu captured breathtaking, ethereal photos of landscapes at night, precisely lit by drone-mounted lights and lasers.\\n\\nWu debuted these specialized lasers last year as part of his incredible Siren series. This new approach is more fluid than the traditional drone-mounted lights Wu has used in other series, like Unfamiliar Light and Lux Noctis. In Thin Places, Wu uses both approaches, as they tell different stories.\\n\\n“There are places in the world where the gap between the seen and unseen feels thinner, where presence shifts in ways that reveal something just beyond reach. Thin Places is about those moments; brief encounters with the beyond,” Wu explains on Instagram.\\n\\n“Certain places seem to hum with presence, and the atmosphere shifts in unexpected ways. Some locations reveal this naturally, while others require the right conditions or the right state of mind. Perhaps the world always holds this quality, and noticing it is simply a matter of being still enough to see,” the photographer continues.\\n\\nAs for dialing in the specific approach — finding the best way to capture a location’s essence — composition and lighting are vital. For Wu, the GFX100RF’s fixed lens, a 35mm f/4 (28mm equivalent), proved to be creatively liberating rather than restrictive.\\n\\n“Essentially, having only one lens choice removes the decision-making processes you usually go through with interchangeable lenses, as well as the physical act of changing lenses in the field, often in extreme conditions,” Wu tells PetaPixel. “While I’m comfortable doing all of the above, working without those processes allows me to engage more immediately with the scene.”\\n\\nThe photographer says that thanks to the GFX100RF’s 102-megapixel image sensor, he is comfortable using the camera’s built-in digital teleconverters and different aspect ratios. The 44 by 33-millimeter sensor delivers 102-megapixel 4:3 photos by default at a 28mm equivalent focal length. However, photographers can crop into a 35mm “lens” (62 megapixels), a 50mm one (31 megapixels), and even a 63mm focal length (20 megapixels). These can be controlled via a rocker switch on the camera.\\n\\nThere is also a new dedicated aspect ratio dial, allowing photographers to swap to aspect ratios like 3:2, 5:4, 65:42, 17:6, 1:1, and more, with megapixel counts ranging from a low of 48 megapixels (17:6) to up to 95 megapixels (5:4).\\n\\nWu used the GFX100RF’s standard 4:3 aspect ratio for his new “hero” shots but used more cinematic aspect ratios for some of his project story photos. Many of these are seen throughout this story.\\n\\nOne of the primary benefits of the GFX100RF’s fixed 35mm f/4 lens is that the camera is relatively small and lightweight. It is Fujifilm’s lightest GFX camera yet, and despite its massive 102-megapixel sensor, it’s not a cumbersome camera.\\n\\n“It felt liberating to carry around such a compact camera while knowing that it had the same resolution as what I usually use for these types of images,” Wu explains. “The reduced weight and size meant I could move more freely in the field, be less laborious when shooting, and experience less fatigue during longer hikes.”\\n\\n“This physical freedom translated directly into creative freedom, allowing me to access positions that might have been more challenging with bulkier equipment.”\\n\\nWu has been using the Fujifilm GFX100II over the past few months, so he’s familiar with the sensor’s resolution, color rendering, and dynamic range.\\n\\n“It’s about enabling this technology in a much smaller form factor that excites me,” Wu says. “The 102-megapixel sensor gives me incredible flexibility in post-production, whether I’m creating large-scale prints or need to crop significantly while maintaining detail. The dynamic range is particularly valuable for my night work, capturing both the darkest shadows and brightest highlights in a single frame.”\\n\\n“I’ve never really enjoyed having a walk-around camera since the Fujifilm X-Pro1, and I think I might start again with this,” Wu concludes.\\n\\nImage credits: All photos © Reuben Wu. Fans can keep up to date with Wu’s latest projects by signing up for an email list on his website and by following Wu on Instagram. “I have a lot of projects in the pipeline,” says Wu, including upcoming exhibitions, a group show at Foster/White Gallery next month, a potential solo show in New York City later this spring, and another collaborative exhibition in the fall.',\n",

       "  'text': 'As conventional AI benchmarking techniques prove inadequate, AI builders are turning to more creative ways to assess the capabilities of generative AI models. For one group of developers, that’s Minecraft, the Microsoft-owned sandbox-building game.\\n\\nThe website Minecraft Benchmark (or MC-Bench) was developed collaboratively to pit AI models against each other in head-to-head challenges to respond to prompts with Minecraft creations. Users can vote on which model did a better job, and only after voting can they see which AI made each Minecraft build.\\n\\nFor Adi Singh, the 12th-grader who started MC-Bench, the value of Minecraft isn’t so much the game itself, but the familiarity that people have with it — after all, it is the best-selling video game of all time. Even for people who haven’t played the game, it’s still possible to evaluate which blocky representation of a pineapple is better realized.\\n\\n“Minecraft allows people to see the progress [of AI development] much more easily,” Singh told TechCrunch. “People are used to Minecraft, used to the look and the vibe.”\\n\\nMC-Bench currently lists eight people as volunteer contributors. Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and Alibaba have subsidized the project’s use of their products to run benchmark prompts, per MC-Bench’s website, but the companies are not otherwise affiliated.\\n\\n“Currently we are just doing simple builds to reflect on how far we’ve come from the GPT-3 era, but [we] could see ourselves scaling to these longer-form plans and goal-oriented tasks,” Singh said. “Games might just be a medium to test agentic reasoning that is safer than in real life and more controllable for testing purposes, making it more ideal in my eyes.”\\n\\nOther games like Pokémon Red, Street Fighter, and Pictionary have been used as experimental benchmarks for AI, in part because the art of benchmarking AI is notoriously tricky.\\n\\nResearchers often test AI models on standardized evaluations, but many of these tests give AI a home-field advantage. Because of the way they’re trained, models are naturally gifted at certain, narrow kinds of problem-solving, particularly problem-solving that requires rote memorization or basic extrapolation.\\n\\nPut simply, it’s hard to glean what it means that OpenAI’s GPT-4 can score in the 88th percentile on the LSAT, but cannot discern how many Rs are in the word “strawberry.” Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieved 62.3% accuracy on a standardized software engineering benchmark, but it is worse at playing Pokémon than most five-year-olds.\\n\\nImage Credits:Minecraft Benchmark\\n\\nMC-Bench is technically a programming benchmark, since the models are asked to write code to create the prompted build, like “Frosty the Snowman” or “a charming tropical beach hut on a pristine sandy shore.”\\n\\nBut it’s easier for most MC-Bench users to evaluate whether a snowman looks better than to dig into code, which gives the project wider appeal — and thus the potential to collect more data about which models consistently score better.\\n\\nWhether those scores amount to much in the way of AI usefulness is up for debate, of course. Singh asserts that they’re a strong signal, though.\\n\\n“The current leaderboard reflects quite closely to my own experience of using these models, which is unlike a lot of pure text benchmarks,” Singh said. “Maybe [MC-Bench] could be useful to companies to know if they’re heading in the right direction.”',\n",

Word of changes to the film’s story from the likes of Zegler — including pointed observations of how the film was dated — were among some of the controversies that have been plaguing the production for more than three years.\\n\\nForbes ‘Snow White’: The Biggest Changes Made From 1937 Animated Classic\\n\\nDespite the controversies and lukewarm reviews from critics, audiences are ultimately going to decide whether Snow White is going to be a hit, beginning with Thursday previews, where the earned $3.5 million, Deadline reported Friday morning.\\n\\nNow, the Hollywood trade is already projection a total for the weekend, and it's not looking good for Disney. Deadline is projecting the film will open in the mid-$40 million range from ticket sales in 4,200 North American theaters.\\n\\nSnow White’s opening falls in line with the low end of Variety’s opening projection on Friday, which pegged the film to bring in $45 million to $55 million in its first weekend frame.\\n\\nForbes ‘Snow White’: Box Office Projections On Downslide For Rachel Zegler Film\\n\\nSnow White’s opening weekend projection has been on the downslide for about a month. In February, Box Office Pro projected that the film would make anywhere from $65 million to $85 million domestically.\\n\\nIf Deadline’s opening projection of Snow White holds and the film grosses in the mid-$40 million range, it will be on par with Disney’s live-action adaptation of Dumbo, which grossed nearly $46 million when it opened on roughly the same number of screens domestically in 2019.\\n\\nDisney Enterprises, Inc.\\n\\n‘Snow White’ Is No ‘Little Mermaid’\\n\\nWhile the numbers can change for the better — or worse — for Snow White over the weekend, one thing is for certain: The Marc Webb-directed fantasy musical has no chance of eclipsing the opening weekend gross of the live-action adaptation of The Little Mermaid in May of 2023.\\n\\nThe Little Mermaid, which stars Halle Bailey as Ariel, brought in $10.3 million in Thursday previews on its way to an opening weekend of $95.5 million. Per The Numbers, The Little Mermaid went on to make nearly $298.2 million domestically and $271.4 million internationally for a worldwide box office tally of $596.6 million against a $250 million production budget before prints and advertising costs.\\n\\nForbes ‘Snow White’ Reviews: Does Rachel Zegler Film Have Critics Seeing Red?\\n\\nVia Deadline, the Hollywood analytics firm The Quorum noted Friday, “[Snow White] was never tracking to open at the same level as [The Little Mermaid], though six weeks ago – at 42 days out – the data suggested that the film could open north of $60M.”\\n\\nWhile Snow White looks to be opening in the same range as Dumbo, it’s not exactly an apples-to-apples (or is it poisoned apples?) comparison.\\n\\nAccording to Deadline, Snow White had a $270 million production budget P&A while Dumbo cost $170 million to make before marketing.\\n\\nWhile reports for the exact production budget of Snow White have varied — Variety said the film cost “more than $250 million” and The Numbers reported a $270 million price tag — Disney’s latest live-action adaptation is facing a steep uphill climb to make up some ground in the coming weeks.\\n\\nForbes Johnny Depp Meets Tim Burton In Animated Clip From Burton Docuseries\\n\\nWhile it doesn’t seem probable, it’s certainly possible, as Disney’s Mufasa: The Lion King has proven recently. Per The Numbers, the prequel to the live-action version of The Lion King earned $35.4 million in its opening weekend Dec. 20-22, 2024, yet managed to gain enough momentum in subsequent weeks.\\n\\nTo date, Mufasa: The Lion King has earned $253.1 million domestically and $464.1 million internationally for a worldwide box office gross of $717.2 million against a $200 million budget before P&A.\\n\\nNote: This box office report will be updated throughout the weekend as new domestic and international numbers become available.

       "  'text': 'SPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers for Season 2, Episode 10 of “Severance,” streaming now on Apple TV+.\\n\\nTramell Tillman was done dancing.\\n\\nAfter his “Severance” character, Mr. Milchick, conducted a memorable and oft-memed “Music Dance Experience” in the Apple TV+ show’s first season, he didn’t think it was possible to catch lightning in a bottle again.\\n\\nBut when director and executive producer Ben Stiller pitched him on a marching band sequence in the Season 2 finale, “Cold Harbor,” Tillman saw an opportunity to tap into his roots. “I went to two HBCUs, and one of them was Jackson State University. They housed the Sonic Boom of the South, one of the best marching bands in the country, and I would watch them during my undergrad years with such awe and amazement in the athleticism, the creativity and the passion that these musicians and dancers served with,” he tells Variety.\\n\\nSo, after Adam Scott’s Mark S. completes the all-important Cold Harbor file, Milchick introduces the Choreography and Merriment department, serving as the drum major (with some slick moves) while they celebrate Mark’s achievement.\\n\\nPopular on Variety\\n\\nIt’s the cherry on top of a fantastic season for Tillman, whose Milchick has delivered some of the series’ most iconic lines, from “Marshmallows are for team players” to “Devour feculence.” Below, Tillman unpacks Milchick’s biggest moments from the finale, from his comedy routine with Kier to that unforgettable marching band sequence.\\n\\nHow physically demanding was it to film those scenes kicking down the bathroom door with the vending machine?\\n\\nYou know, it really felt good. Because Dan [Erickson] and his whole writing team did such a great job to craft the story of where Milchick came from to get to that point, I didn’t have to act so much in order to knock the hell out of that vending machine down. It was so gratifying, because the choreography for that vending machine was originally something totally different.\\n\\nI was actually supposed to go down with the vending machine. But as luck would have it, there was one particular run where I ran into the vending machine and knocked it down on its end, and I just stood there. And that was the take that they went with. This is so much cooler! And then just did this superhero hop on top of the vending machine like a badass. I was like, let’s go! This is so much fun.\\n\\nIt’s interesting that you call him a badass, because it feels like there’s been a reevaluation among fans surrounding this character that once may have been dismissed as simply a villain. What has it been like watching viewers develop empathy as we’ve learned more about Milchick?\\n\\nI love it. I absolutely love it. It’s so rewarding to see, because it’s a very human thing for us to see someone and automatically have our own opinions of it. It’s protection. We do that for ourselves. But then to watch people’s opinions shift — and there are people that are still not completely on board with the fact that he’s a good guy, which I totally respect — but the fact that people are starting to question that, I was like, “We’re tapping into something. This is good. This is where the conversation starts.”\\n\\nThe whole show talks about, “Who are you?” We lead with that from day one, Season 1, Episode 1: “Who are you?” I think Milchick in particular has this identity journey where he is trying to figure out who he is, and who he is within this company.\\n\\nCourtesy of Apple\\n\\nThis season has really started to scratch the surface on what race means within Lumon and the ways that it affects Milchick. What was your first thought when you read the scene where he receives the paintings of Kier depicted as a Black man?\\n\\nBefore I even saw that story in the script, Dan Erickson came up to me and asked me if it was OK to include that story in his arc. And I appreciate that. We took a risk by telling that story, because if we did not tell the story and give it justice, the show could take a total different bend, and we could alienate a good portion of our audience. So there was a lot of conversation that I had with with Dan, with Ben, with Sydney Cole Alexander, who plays Natalie brilliantly, about how these two people of color, these forward-facing people of color, how they carry on in this corporate structure, knowing that the corporate structure is a little bit racist.\\n\\nAnd so what I appreciate about that day, when Sydney and I were on to film that scene, is that Ben was essentially hands off. He said, “You all do what you want to do.” And yes, he directed behind the scenes about microscopic moments, but for the most part, that was a conversation, a non-verbal conversation between Natalie and Milchick that Sydney and I were finding in the moment as soon as the board ended the call. And that was electric.\\n\\nTo carry that moment on into Episode 5, right before he has his performance review, I was so grateful they kept that scene, because that was under discussion to be chopped. But I said it’s so important for Milchick to have another opportunity to connect with another person of color about what he has experienced, and for Sydney, to be able to have her character really respond or not respond.\\n\\nThis season, Milchick has been consistently reprimanded for using big words, despite many other characters like Cobel and Jame Eagan also using colorful language. Did you view that as an extension of those racist undertones within the company?\\n\\nIt was a total microaggression. These people are policing his language and telling him what they feel is appropriate for this man to say. How belittling and controlling it is of Drummond to approach Milchick while he’s being reprimanded for something totally different, to then castigate him and say, “No, change your language. On top of you not bringing Mark in to refine to get to 100% for Cold Harbor, I am now going to stick the knife even deeper and chastise you because you are speaking in a way that you should not be speaking.” And it’s not even about protocol. It’s probably more about ego than anything, because Drummond probably doesn’t know what “devour feculence” means. He has no idea, no but he learned that day.\\n\\nCourtesy of Apple\\n\\nYour delivery of “mon-o-syl-a-bic-ally” and “devour feculence” in Episode 9 are some of my favorite line readings of the season. How did you approach that tense confrontation with Drummond when we see Milchick push back for the first time?\\n\\nI just had to lean into the moments that I’ve experienced, where I felt I was being policed in my speech. You know, growing up in PG County and having the importance of education, it was impressed upon us that we were intelligent, and we presented ourselves intelligently. But unfortunately, in the era I was growing up, intelligence was close to whiteness.\\n\\nSo anytime you were speaking in a certain way, using your vowels and consonants, it was like, “Oh, you’re trying to be white.” So regardless of the fact that these people who had issues with my vocabulary and my diction, it was nothing about me. It was all about their ego, and what they saw was an expectation of me. So for me, that moment was a big F-U. You’re not gonna control my speech. You’re not gonna tell me what to do. It was like baby Tramell, teenage Tramell rose up in that moment through Milchick. And he checked him. It was necessary.\\n\\nWe’ve got to unpack that insane marching band scene. Did that come about because of the audience reaction to your Music Dance Experience moves from Season 1? How long did it take to learn the sequence?\\n\\nI did not want to do it. And when I saw that it was a possibility, I said to a couple of the creators, “I just don’t want Milchick dancing in every single season.” Because I was concerned that we were going to try to replicate the Music Dance Experience. You can’t do that. It’s iconic, and it was special for what it was. But then Ben told me he was bringing in a marching band. I went to two HBCUs, and one of them was Jackson State University, and they housed the Sonic Boom of the South, one of the best marching bands in the country, and I would watch them during my undergrad years with such awe and amazement in the athleticism, the creativity and the passion that these musicians and dancers served with.\\n\\nSo when Ben told me there was a marching band coming in, I said, “OK, hold on. What kind of marching band? Military style, or is it HBCU style? He said he wasn’t sure at the moment. I asked him, “How did you want me to participate? Did you want me to be the band director, or did you want me to be the drum major?” And I said to myself, if this is going to be HBCU style, like Jackson State University, I’m gonna be the drum major.\\n\\nCourtesy of Apple\\n\\nIt was so much fun. And I have to give credit to Ty and Teddy and Tyrone, who were the choreographers and the organizers of Choreography and Merriment, essentially bringing all those musicians and dancers together in this space to teach the choreography and get the moves right. It was epic. We had so much fun, I think we filmed that sequence over a couple of weeks, and that includes the rehearsals that we had on my on our days off, and making sure that we had everything that we need to make this absolutely incredible. I had a great time bonding with the band.\\n\\nRight before that moment, you perform a strange comedy routine with an animatronic Kier. It felt like the characters were using a script at first, but after Kier insults Milchick’s vocabulary, it seemed he snapped, ribbing Kier right back. What’s the truth behind that moment?\\n\\nIt was a scripted moment, as far as the jokes in the beginning, but then shit just got real. Again, this man has been holding onto so much, and things have just been compacted for him. It also goes back to “devour feculence.” I think that was not a planned moment. It just came out, mon-o-syl-a-bic-ally. I think we’re seeing the remnants of what is happening as the facade of Milchick starts to crack a little bit. The figure, the man, the myth, the legend, is right here, and he’s doing the very same thing that he has been chastised for so long, policing his language. He’s standing up to that.\\n\\nIf we go back to Choreography and Merriment, I think there’s something about the presentation of those songs. “The Kier Hymn” is done very traditionally, very by the book. But then you have this other number, “The Ballad of Ambrose and Gunnell,” and we see Milchick get down. I think that’s by design. We’re finding ways that Milchick is infusing his likeness, his personality, his history, into the world of Lumon: through the leather jacket, through the ORTBO outfit and the Choreography and Merriment number.\\n\\nCourtesy of Apple\\n\\nDo you believe Milchick has it in him to stand up to Lumon once and for all?\\n\\nI think we have so much more to mine before we’re able to make that decision. We talk about how Lumon is very cultish, I relate that to so many of the cults that have existed and that still exist today. So many of the people that have been a part of these cults have been brainwashed and indoctrinated, and it’s not easy to walk away. Some people will never leave. Does he have it in him? I don’t know. But we need to know more about who this man is, for us to figure out where he’s headed.\\n\\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The main attraction on tonight’s (Mar. 21) episode of SmackDown in Italy was the return of Roman Reigns, who expected to be confronted by CM Punk and Seth Rollins.\\n\\nRoman first had the ring to himself (along with Paul Heyman) as he explained why he beat the shit out of Punk and Rollins at the end of their steel cage match in Madison Square Garden. He was simply getting revenge for what they did to him at the Royal Rumble. Roman finished up by saying if anybody in the back wants to do something about it, he’ll hang out in the ring for about 15 more minutes.\\n\\nRollins was the first man out to interrupt him. Seth said Roman made a mistake when he stopped him from ending Punk’s career in the steel cage, because CM is a cancer to WWE. There’s also the fact that Reigns and Rollins have so much history together that it’s not even about Punk. There’s no Roman Reigns without Seth Rollins, and vice versa, but they can no longer coexist with each other.\\n\\nJust as Seth was about to take off his ridiculous purple clothes so he and Roman could punch each other in the face, Punk crashed the party with a taped fist and a microphone.\\n\\nCM reminded Roman that the Royal Rumble is every man for himself, and Reigns would have never even made it there if Punk didn’t help his family win at War Games. Punk said Heyman still owes him that favor from War Games, and he thanked Paul for delivering Roman to him on a silver platter.\\n\\nReigns was understandably confused as to what that meant. When he looked over at the Wiseman for an explanation, CM hit him with the mic and the fight was on. It was a chaotic scene as all three stars exchanged blows. It also came off a bit comedic to me as they each took separate turns pointing at the very large WrestleMania sign in between trading fisticuffs.\\n\\nThe show ended without an official announcement, but it’s very clear that we’re getting a triple threat match between Roman Reigns, Seth Rollins, and CM Punk at WrestleMania 41.\\n\\nCatch up on all the results from SmackDown in our live blog right here.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\\n\\nSelena Gomez and Benny Blanco explore their romantic past, present, and future on their album I Said I Love You First, and no track captures the agony of a past on-off relationship quite like “Don’t Wanna Cry.”\\n\\nIn the song, Gomez sings about seeing her partner, likely someone in the spotlight, involved with another woman in the first verse: “Left the door wide open for the whole wide world to see you / And you kiss her right in front of me like I’m not even there.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the pre-chorus, she talks about all the trauma the relationship has caused her and how much she has kept to herself. She sings, “I should cause a scene for shit you have done to me / The saddest part is we both know that I would never leave / You know how it goes, everybody knows / I’m just another hand you hold.” She blames herself in the chorus for continuing the relationship even though she knows her partner’s character.\\n\\nGomez didn’t reveal the song’s subject. While those who know the singer’s dating history may be quick to assume the song is about her ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber, with whom she had a turbulent six-year on-off relationship that ended in 2018, Gomez cautioned fans to be careful about jumping to conclusions.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn an interview with Benny Blanco for Spotify’s Countdown To..., the singer revealed she was inspired by her friends’ experiences as well. She explained that while ultimately, the audience will interpret things as they will, “I would like to say most of this album has nothing to do with what everyone may go to. And I think it’s important for me to say that because I’ve evolved so much, and I have experienced life with new people. I’ve had to go through transitions with friends and lose people in my life and gain new people, and I’ve had a whole new life forever so it’s up for whatever people want [to interpret things as], but to me, it was about both of our pasts and our history and also just inspired by friends and relationships, like some songs were actually meant [to be] about friendships in my life and I think that’s what to me the album was about.”\\n\\nJames Devaney\\n\\nBlanco added, “I think the best part about music is a song that you may have written in a moment about something [may be] completely perceived as something else to everybody who has listened to it.”\\n\\nGomez’s “Don’t Wanna Cry” ends on a hopeful note, as she knows the relationship will someday end for good (She sings in the bridge: “One day, you’re gonna wake up / But all that’s left is my pillow and makeup / Saying ‘c’est la vie’ ’cause, baby, the game’s up / Now I found another hand to hold”). Gomez, of course, has realized that dream in real life, as she now has a billion-dollar makeup company and a smitten fiancé in her partner, Blanco.\\n\\nBut the lyrics capture the pain of a past love—and make her present romance all the more satisfying. Read through them below.\\n\\nVerse 1:\\n\\nLeft the door wide open for the whole wide world to see you\\n\\nAnd you kiss her right in front of me like I’m not even there\\n\\n\\n\\nPre-Chorus:\\n\\nI should cause a scene for shit you have done to me\\n\\nThe saddest part is we both know that I would never leave\\n\\nYou know how it goes, everybody knows\\n\\nI’m just another hand you hold\\n\\n\\n\\nChorus:\\n\\nI don’t wanna cry now\\n\\nI don’t wanna cry now\\n\\nThere’s nothing to say, it’s not gonna change\\n\\nBaby, I know I’m to blame\\n\\nI don’t wanna cry now\\n\\nI don’t wanna cry now\\n\\nThere’s nothing to say, it’s not gonna change\\n\\nBaby, I know I’m to blame\\n\\n\\n\\nVerse 2:\\n\\nI know that I said I’d forgive you once, but, baby\\n\\nIt’s been a hundred timеs, and I still crawl back for more\\n\\n\\n\\nPre-Chorus:\\n\\nI should cause a scenе for shit you have done to me\\n\\nThe saddest part is we both know that I would never leave\\n\\nYou know how it goes, everybody knows\\n\\nI’m just another hand you hold\\n\\n\\n\\nChorus:\\n\\nI don’t wanna cry now\\n\\nI don’t wanna cry now\\n\\nThere’s nothing to say, it’s not gonna change\\n\\nBaby, I know I’m to blame\\n\\nI don’t wanna cry now\\n\\nI don’t wanna cry now\\n\\nThere’s nothing to say, it’s not gonna change\\n\\nBaby, I know I’m to blame\\n\\n\\n\\nBridge:\\n\\nOne day, you’re gonna wake up\\n\\nBut all that’s left is my pillow and makeup\\n\\nSaying “c’est la vie” ’cause, baby, the game’s up\\n\\nNow I found another hand to hold\\n\\n\\n\\nOutro:\\n\\n(I’m to blame)\\n\\n(I’m to blame)',\n",

McNeese pulled off an upset of Clemson in the first round, and Colorado State beat Memphis in a rare matchup where the No. 12 seed was favored. However, no team seeded 13-16 won a game after the First Four for the first time since 2017.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThat means your bracket might be in great shape! But remember, so is everyone else’s.

The Blue Devils now face Baylor, which has a terrific group of guards but lacks size in the paint. More important than Friday’s result was the fact that Duke got Cooper Flagg back in the lineup. The likely top pick in the NBA Draft this June started and looked fully recovered from his ankle injury in 22 productive minutes. Seed 1 Record 32-3 Games No. 16 Mount St. Mary's 93-49 ACC East 2 Florida Gators 2 Last Rank The Gators handled Norfolk State on Friday evening, overwhelming their less athletic and less physical foe. The road gets much tougher, though, as the two-time reigning national champions loom in the second round. Even with their phenomenal depth and physicality, Florida faces a sizable test. Seed 1 Record 31-4 Games No. 16 Norfolk State 95-69 SEC West 3 Houston Cougars 4 Last Rank The Cougars suffocated SIUE on Thursday, holding the overmatched No. 16 seed to just 16 points after halftime. Most importantly, though, J’Wan Roberts started and looked healthy in 20 minutes, a massive development after an ankle injury suffered in the Big 12 tournament briefly put his status in doubt. The level of difficulty rises significantly now, with Gonzaga — a top-10 team in adjusted marginal efficiency, per KenPom — dead ahead. Seed 1 Record 31-4 Games No. 16 SIU Edwardsville 78-40 Big 12 Midwest 4 Auburn Tigers 3 Last Rank The Tigers started extremely slowly, only leading Alabama State by one late in the first half, but a 9-0 run before the break helped propel the game into blowout range. Bruce Pearl’s team now faces Creighton, which could provide some matchup issues thanks to Ryan Kalkbrenner’s dominance in the paint. Auburn looks like the most vulnerable No. 1 seed. Seed 1 Record 29-5 Games No. 16 Alabama State 83-63 SEC South 5 St. John's Red Storm 5 Last Rank The Johnnies completely overwhelmed Omaha with their massive athleticism edge. They remain one of the most physically imposing teams in the field, and Rick Pitino is masterful on the sideline. A matchup ripe with storylines awaits after Arkansas knocked off Kansas; Pitino and John Calipari have quite a history from their Louisville/Kentucky days. Seed 2 Record 31-4 Games No. 15 Omaha 83-53 Big East West 6 Alabama Crimson Tide 6 Last Rank Alabama outlasted a feisty effort from Robert Morris on Friday, and its terrific offense made the difference, led by 22 points from fifth-year senior Mark Sears. Importantly, the Crimson Tide also got seven minutes from Grant Nelson, back in action after a leg injury. Nate Oats smartly limited his minutes, but Nelson looks ready for a long run in March. Seed 2 Record 26-8 Games No. 15 Robert Morris 90-81 SEC East 7 Texas Tech Red Raiders 7 Last Rank A deserved hat tip to UNC Wilmington, which stayed with Texas Tech for all 40 minutes on Thursday. Grant McCasland’s Red Raiders had injury concerns entering the tournament, and although Darrion Williams logged 30 minutes after sitting out Texas Tech’s Big 12 tournament loss, Chance McMillian was unable to suit up. His status could dictate this team’s upside. Seed 3 Record 26-8 Games No. 14 UNC Wilmington 82-72 Big 12 West 8 Tennessee Volunteers 8 Last Rank Wofford was a challenging underdog, but Tennessee controlled the game for the entire 40 minutes and won comfortably. Chaz Lanier shined with 29 points, including six triples, while the Vols’ defense held Wofford to just 41 percent shooting inside the arc. Tennessee now has a bruising matchup with UCLA ahead on Saturday, which should be a war in the paint. Seed 2 Record 28-7 Games No. 15 Wofford 77-62 SEC Midwest 9 Michigan State Spartans 9 Last Rank It wasn’t easy, but Michigan State took care of business against a competitive Bryant team on Friday night. Tom Izzo’s squad has drastically exceeded expectations all season, and the Spartans can continue that trend against New Mexico on Sunday. Their physicality will be tested against a frontcourt that features Nelly Junior Joseph, a giant in the paint who gave Marquette problems on Friday night (19 points, seven rebounds). Seed 2 Record 28-6 Games No. 15 Bryant 91-54 Big Ten South 10 Wisconsin Badgers 10 Last Rank The Badgers took care of Montana despite having to play at altitude against a team comfortable with such conditions. The offense shined once again, and that prolific attack remains Wisconsin’s leading hope for a deep March run. However, another team comfortable at elevation, red-hot BYU, could be a significant challenge on Saturday. Seed 3 Record 27-9 Games No. 14 Montana 85-66 Big Ten East 11 Iowa State Cyclones 11 Last Rank No Keshon Gilbert, no problem. Iowa State rolled over Lipscomb in the opening round on Friday, using a 20-point performance from Milan Momcilovic to comfortably defeat the Bisons. TJ Otzelberger’s team now faces Ole Miss, which will test Cyclones’ backcourt with its strong group of guards. Seed 3 Record 25-9 Games No. 14 Lipscomb 82-55 Big 12 South 12 Kentucky Wildcats 12 Last Rank The Wildcats’ defense has been their biggest question mark all season, but they shut down perimeter-starved Troy on Friday night. Most importantly, UK did not turn the ball over, and Lamont Butler’s presence at point guard (he played 25 minutes after missing the SEC tournament loss to Alabama) clearly stabilized the Cats. Seed 3 Record 23-11 Games No. 14 Troy 76-57 SEC Midwest 13 Maryland Terrapins 13 Last Rank Maryland dominated Grand Canyon on Friday, an impressive showing against a veteran-laden mid-major that won an NCAA Tournament game last season. The Terrapins got double-digit scoring performances from five different players, including DeShawn Harris-Smith — an important showing for a bench piece on a thin team. Seed 4 Record 26-8 Games No. 13 Grand Canyon 81-49 Big Ten West 14 Arizona Wildcats 14 Last Rank The Wildcats exerted their dominance in the paint in Friday’s matchup with Akron. Arizona won the rebounding battle 53-22 in one of the most lopsided mismatches of the first round. Trey Townsend, who became a star last March with Oakland, helped lead the charge with four offensive rebounds, and Tobe Awaka racked up eight boards in just 17 minutes. The Wildcats’ physicality now awaits a stiffer test against Oregon on Sunday. Seed 4 Record 23-12 Games No. 13 Akron 93-65 Big 12 East 15 Illinois Fighting Illini 15 Last Rank Illinois conquered First Four winner Xavier, knocking down 12 triples, led by big man Tomislav Ivisic’s 4-of-9 showing from deep. Brad Underwood’s team is ascending late in the season, having won five of its last six games, and it has a likely NBA Draft lottery pick in Lithuanian freshman Kasparas Jakucionis. Injuries and illness played roles in a streaky season, but with the entire roster now healthy, Illinois’ upside is huge. Seed 6 Record 25-14 Games No. 11 Xavier 86-73 Big Ten Midwest 16 Purdue Boilermakers NR Last Rank The Boilermakers enter the rankings after a decisive win over High Point. The underdog Panthers were a media darling thanks to their explosive offense, but Purdue held them to just 63 points. Trey Kaufman-Renn tallied 21 points, and Big Ten player of the year Braden Smith racked up 20 points and six assists to lead the Boilermakers. Matt Painter’s team now faces McNeese, which upset Clemson on Thursday. Seed 4 Record 23-11 Games No. 13 High Point 75-63 Big Ten Midwest\\n\\nThe Bracket Central series is sponsored by E*Trade from Morgan Stanley.\\n\\nThe Athletic maintains full editorial independence.

       "  'text': 'The New England Patriots are in a tricky spot with the fourth overall pick, which is why any move the teams ahead of them in the 2025 NFL Draft is worth paying attention to.\\n\\nAccording to multiple reports, the New York Giants agreed to a two-year, $8 million deal with Jameis Winston on Friday. The NFC East side’s deal came amid their interest in Aaron Rodgers.\\n\\nWhat does this mean for the Patriots?\\n\\nThe Tennessee Titans seem to be on track toward selecting quarterback Cam Ward with the No. 1 overall pick. It’s unknown what the Cleveland Browns will do at No. 2, and the Giants also are a wild card with the third overall pick.\\n\\nRecent mock drafts had New York taking QB Shedeur Sanders. That would be great for New England since if two signal-callers get drafted in the top three, it would allow Mike Vrabel’s side to select either Abdul Carter or Travis Hunter, arguably the top two players in the class.\\n\\nStory continues below advertisement\\n\\nAt first glance, the Winston agreement might deter the Giants from selecting a quarterback. However, a top NFL insider laid out their plans clearly.\\n\\n“This does not change the #Giants’ pursuit of Aaron Rodgers or alter any other possible QB routes. Just getting a veteran QB under contract in a QB room that only had Tommy DeVito coming into the day,” Mike Garafolo posted on X.\\n\\nSimple enough, then. The Patriots should hope that Rodgers, who reportedly visited the Steelers on Friday, chooses to sign with Pittsburgh. That would force the Giants to lean toward selecting a quarterback in the NFL draft. There is also a case that New York might go in that direction since it would be foolish to have two veteran signal-callers in the room. The smart thing to do is draft a quarterback for Winston to mentor. Then again, this is the same team that let Saquon Barkley walk and signed Daniel Jones to a hefty extension.\\n\\nBut things are trending well for the Patriots heading into the 2025 NFL Draft.',\n",

Since the flyby happens out of communication range, the mission team won't hear back from Parker until Tuesday afternoon.\\n\\nParker is the fastest spacecraft built by humans, and is once again set to hit 430,000 mph (690,000 kph) at closest approach.\\n\\nLaunched in 2018 to get a close-up look at the sun, Parker has since flown straight through its crownlike outer atmosphere, or corona.\\n\\nScientists hope the data from Parker will help them better understand why the sun's outer atmosphere is hundreds of times hotter than its surface and what drives the solar wind, the supersonic stream of charged particles constantly blasting away from the sun.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Tens of millions of miles beyond Earth, a nuclear-powered, car-sized rover is climbing a Martian mountain.\\n\\nNASA\\'s Curiosity rover, while investigating Mars\\' past, has snapped over 683,790 pictures as it\\'s rumbled over 21 miles of unforgiving desert terrain since 2012, and a recent view shows the space agency\\'s robot overlooking a vast Martian wilderness.\\n\\nSome 3.7 billion years ago, a large object smashed into Mars, leaving the sizeable, 96-mile-wide Gale Crater we see today. When the region\\'s surface rebounded after the powerful collision, it left a central peak, Mount Sharp, which preserves layers of the intriguing, and watery, Mars past.\\n\\nFrom its perch in the foothills of the 3.4-mile-high mountain, you can see over an expanse of plains, called Aeolis Palus, and beyond that the hilly walls of Gale Crater. In the foreground, Martian hills are shadowed in the low sunlight.\\n\\nThis view, captured on March 18, 2025, was the Curiosity rover\\'s 4,484th Martian day, or Sol, on the Red Planet.

Credit: NASA / JPL-Caltech\\n\\nToday, the Martian world we see is 1,000 times drier than the driest desert on Earth. But evidence gathered by rovers and spacecraft operated by NASA and other space agencies shows this wasn\\'t always the case. A vast Mars ocean may have blanketed a swath of the world, and lakes once fed gushing rivers and streams.\\n\\nAs Curiosity has scaled Mount Sharp, it has encountered rocks with minerals (sulphates) that show when Mars began to dry out. It has also revealed ripple formations on the surface, which is compelling evidence of small waves breaking on lake shores billions of years ago. Observations like this suggest that Mars once was warm, wet, and quite habitable before it gradually transformed into the extremely dry and frigid desert we see today.\\n\\n\"Taken together, the evidence points to Gale Crater (and Mars in general) as a place where life — if it ever arose — might have survived for some time,\" NASA explained.\\n\\nStill today, there\\'s no certain proof microbial life ever existed on Mars. But Curiosity\\'s robotic sibling, the Perseveranc e rover, has found intriguing rock samples that could potentially show evidence of past microbial activity. (The samples must be robotically returned to Earth to inspect.)\\n\\nCuriosity is currently headed to a new destination on Mount Sharp, a place home to expansive and compelling \"boxworks\" formations. From space, they look like spiderwebs. \"It’s believed to have formed when minerals carried by Mount Sharp\\'s last pulses of water settled into fractures in surface rock and then hardened,\" NASA explained. \"As portions of the rock eroded away, what remained were the minerals that had cemented themselves in the fractures, leaving the weblike boxwork.\"\\n\\nWhat more might the boxworks reveal? Godspeed, Curiosity.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) today reported 30 more cases in a measles outbreak in the western part of the state near the New Mexico border, as the New Mexico Department of health added 4 new cases to its total, pushing the outbreak total to 351.\\n\\nMeanwhile, as global cases surge, a handful of states reported new cases in people who had connections to international travel. In a weekly update today, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it has received reports of 378 cases this year, well past the 285 cases reported for all of 2024.\\n\\nThe cases are from 18 jurisdictions, and 90% are linked to three outbreaks. The CDC’s update includes the first cases of the year from Kansas, Ohio, and Michigan. Kansas last week reported its first measles infection since 2018, and media reports say at least six cases have been reported in the southwest part of the state in Grant and Stevens counties.\\n\\nSteady rise in Texas hot spot\\n\\nTexas has now reported cases from 14 counties, though most are in Gaines County where the outbreak began in a Mennonite community that has low childhood immunization levels. So far, 40 patients have been hospitalized, and the number of deaths remains at one.\\n\\nOf the state’s 309 cases, 307 were unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status. TDSHS added that three cases reported earlier as vaccinated were determined to be unvaccinated, two of whom were immunized 1 or 2 days before their symptoms began. Another was a Lubbock resident who had a vaccine reaction rather than a measles infection; that case has been removed from the outbreak total.\\n\\nOfficials said they expect more cases in the outbreak area, due to the highly contagious nature of the disease.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the New Mexico Department of Health (NMDH) reported four new cases today, raising the state’s total to 42. All of the new cases are from Lea County, which borders the Gaines County hot spot in Texas.\\n\\nOklahoma had earlier reported four probable cases that are linked to the Texas outbreak.\\n\\nStates track exposures\\n\\nAmid the growing outbreak centered in west Texas, state health departments are on high alert and tracking potential exposures.\\n\\nEarlier this week, New Mexico officials warned of potential exposure in Guadalupe and Valencia counties after a Texas traveler visited the area while infectious with measles. Exposure sites included a travel center, a hotel, a restaurant, and a church.\\n\\nSo far, no cases have been reported from either of the counties. Miranda Durham, MD, NMDH’s chief medical officer, said, \"When someone with measles travels, the virus can spread to unprotected communities—particularly during high-travel periods like spring break. Vaccination is our strongest defense: one dose of vaccine is 93% effective, and two doses are 97% effective.”\\n\\nVaccination is our strongest defense: one dose of vaccine is 93% effective, and two doses are 97% effective.\\n\\nElsewhere, the Alabama Department of Public Health said yesterday that it is investigating possible exposures after it was notified that an unvaccinated child who traveled through the state tested positive for measles.\\n\\nMore cases linked to international travel\\n\\nMeanwhile, the number of cases linked to international travel continues to grow. The Ohio Department of Health yesterday reported its first case of the year, which involves an unvaccinated adult from Ashtabula County who had contact with someone who recently traveled internationally.\\n\\nAlso, the Maryland Department of Health yesterday reported two cases in Prince George County residents who recently traveled together internationally. In California, the Tuolumne County Public Health Department reported two cases, an adult and a child who had recently traveled internationally.',\n",

A huge thanks to our incisive panelists and the many insightful conversations I either had or overheard.\\n\\nSTAT Breakthrough East\\n\\nBrooke Alexander for STAT\\n\\nTons of stories on the site right now if you want to catch up on what you missed — and you should — but here are some highlights:\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nOne of the day’s recurring themes was that the return of President Donald Trump to the Oval Office has drastically changed the practice of science. That could have deadly consequences, according to former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Tom Frieden. Talking about Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Frieden said that messing with vaccines and measles is a public health disaster waiting to happen. Former Food and Drug Administration lead Scott Gottlieb had a similar message for the current health chief.\\n\\nEveryone wants the wildly popular GLP-1 drugs to treat diabetes and obesity, and investors are pouring money into more research. But there’s a catch, according to health executives from Ro and Health Included. Ongoing employer concerns over cost and a lack of patient adherence remain stubborn obstacles to wider adoption.\\n\\nGene therapy pioneer Jim Wilson spoke about how the field is currently clouded with “irrational pessimism.” Wilson acknowledged that researchers still must answer questions surrounding the treatments’ long-term safety. How would he assuage investors? Read on.\\n\\nAnd finally: Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill! A panel about Bill Nye the Science Guy’s new adventure — raising awareness about ataxia, a rare movement disorder — morphed into a critique of Kennedy and other health leaders. “We really try in planetary science to stay away from the politics. But man, it’s really hard right now. This is so extreme.”\\n\\nDisability rights under attack\\n\\nThe disability community has been on edge since President Donald Trump’s inauguration. The administration has targeted accessibility, but the main focus of their ire has been curbing other diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. Maybe this is changing? Here are two disability-related items for your consideration:\\n\\nThe Department of Justice rescinded documents Wednesday that provided guidance on how to implement the Americans with Disabilities Act. The documents helped institutions navigate disability rights concerning hospital visits, employees wearing masks and their rights during the Covid-19 pandemic.\\n\\nLast fall, 17 states filed a lawsuit alleging that Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 — a cornerstone of disability rights legislation — was unconstitutional. Disability advocates have picked up their public opposition to Texas v. Becerra in recent months, saying it could prove catastrophic for Americans with disabilities. To learn more about how this suit could possibly torpedo the federal government’s ability to secure rights for people with disabilities, check out my conversation with Claudia Center, legal director of the Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund.\\n\\nWHO calls for help on TB outbreak\\n\\nMonday is World Tuberculosis Day, and the World Health Organization marked the occasion Thursday by releasing a grim statement about how the United States’ retreat from global health is imperiling efforts to fight tuberculosis.\\n\\nWHO reported that severe disruptions in the tuberculosis response have been seen in numerous countries, most notably in parts of Africa, Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Twenty-seven countries are facing breakdowns in their response. The news comes in the wake of Elon Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service cutting funding for the congressionally created agency U.S. Agency for International Development.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nEarlier this week, Helen Branswell quoted what Handaa Enkh-Amgalan, a member of the WHO Civil Society Task Force on Tuberculosis, had to say about the cuts: “We are on the brink of a crisis, one that could reverberate across borders and generations if we don’t act decisively.”\\n\\nDOGE targeting layoffs for HHS research agency\\n\\nA small sliver of the Department of Health and Human Services that focuses on health care quality, outcomes and cost is the latest agency to sit in the crosshairs of Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service.\\n\\nThe Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has about 300 employees and a budget of $369 million, but employees told STAT’s John Wilkerson that the staff could soon be reduced by 80% or 90% after DOGE cuts.\\n\\nAHRQ does the kind of research that fits well with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s broader health plans — investigating chronic disease and obesity and pushing insurers to cover free mammograms. Kennedy even glowingly spoke about plans to work with AHRQ during his confirmation hearing. Read John Wilkerson’s story for more.\\n\\nEgg (price) drop? Not so fast\\n\\nI cheered last weekend when I saw egg prices at my co-op dropped from $8 to $5 a carton. Alas, I may have spoken too soon: the recent dip in wholesale egg prices could soon reverse, writes former Food and Drug Administration head Scott Gottlieb.\\n\\nNorth American flyways typically remain quiet in February, but with spring approaching, wild birds are resuming their seasonal migrations, potentially triggering renewed outbreaks of the deadly virus.\\n\\nShoring up the health of poultry, and thus the American public, is not an easy task, however. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed allowing the virus to spread freely through flocks, but that strategy is impractical and risky. Prevention is the best method, and federal officials recently released a five-step plan, but political and technical realities would also complicate this strategy. Read more to find out Gottlieb’s suggested solution.\\n\\nWhat we’re reading',\n",
