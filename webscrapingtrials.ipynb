The charges relate to four separate women. Brand has been interviewed multiple times by police since an investigation by the Sunday Times, the Times and Channel 4\\'s Dispatches in September 2023 revealed multiple serious allegations against him. The 49-year-old has previously denied the allegations, calling them \"very, very hurtful\", and saying his relationships have been \"always consensual\".\\n\\nIn a short statement, the Metropolitan Police said it had written to Brand to inform him that he was being charged with one allegation of rape, one allegation of indecent assault, one of oral rape and two further counts of sexual assault. The force said it is alleged that: In 1999 a woman was raped in the Bournemouth area.\\n\\nIn 2001 a woman was indecently assaulted in the Westminster area of London.\\n\\nIn 2004 a woman was orally raped and sexually assaulted in the Westminster area of London.\\n\\nBetween 2004 and 2005, a woman was sexually assaulted in the Westminster area of London. Brand has been told to appear at Westminster Magistrates\\' Court on 2 May, but he is believed to be in the United States. In these situations, where a suspect may be overseas, prosecutors seek to agree the defendant\\'s return. If there is no co-operation from a suspect, authorities then consider seeking extradition.\\n\\nPolice investigation\\n\\nJaswant Narwal of the Crown Prosecution Service said: \"We have today authorised the Metropolitan Police to charge Russell Brand with a number of sexual offences. \"We carefully reviewed the evidence after a police investigation into allegations made following the broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary in September 2023. \"We have concluded that Russell Brand should be charged with offences including rape, sexual assault and indecent assault. These relate to reported non-recent offences between 1999 and 2005, involving four women. \"The Crown Prosecution Service reminds everyone that criminal proceedings are active, and the defendant has the right to a fair trial. It is extremely important that there be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.\" The Metropolitan Police\\'s detective superintendent Andy Furphy, who is leading the investigation, said: \"The women who have made reports continue to receive support from specially trained officers. \"The Met\\'s investigation remains open and detectives ask anyone who has been affected by this case, or anyone who has any information, to come forward and speak with police. A dedicated team of investigators is available via email at CIT@met.police.uk. \"Support is also available by contacting the independent charity, Rape Crisis at 24/7 Rape and Sexual Abuse Support Line.\"\\n\\nReuters',\n",

Trump also closed a trade loophole that had allowed low-value packages from China to enter the U.S duty-free.\\n\\n\"The U.S move is not in line with international trade rules, seriously undermines China\\'s legitimate and lawful rights and interests, and is a typical unilateral bullying practice,\" China\\'s finance ministry said.\\n\\nChina called the new round of U.S tariffs a \"blatant\" violation of World Trade Organization rules and have requested consultations at the WTO.\\n\\nTrump accused China of panicking in a comment on Truth Social.\\n\\n\"China played it wrong, they panicked - the one thing they cannot afford to do!\", he wrote on Friday.\\n\\nMATCHING DUTIES\\n\\nChina\\'s finance ministry matched U.S. duties with additional tariffs of 34% on all U.S. goods from April 10, on top of the 10%-15% tariffs it imposed on some U.S. agriculture goods in March and 10%-15% tariffs on some energy and farming machinery in February.\\n\\nAgricultural trade took a deeper hit as Chinese customs imposed an immediate suspension on imports of U.S. sorghum from C&D (USA) INC, as well as inbound shipments of poultry and bone meal from three U.S. firms.\\n\\nChina\\'s biggest imports from the U.S. are soybeans, oilseeds and grains, amounting to $13.4 billion in 2024, as well as $14.7 billion of various fuels and $15.3 billion of electrical machinery, according to U.S. trade data.\\n\\n\"With 34% tariff it will not be possible for U.S. agricultural products to enter China.

The affected include 15 companies in industries including defence and aerospace, as well as non-profit group Coalition For A Prosperous America, which in the past had advocated for the Trump administration to decouple the U.S. economy from China.\\n\\nAnother 11 U.S. entities were added to the \"unreliable entity\" list, which allows Beijing to take punitive actions against foreign entities. The targeted firms include Skydio Inc. and BRINC Drones over arms sales to democratically governed Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory.\\n\\nIt also launched an anti-dumping probe into imports of certain medical CT tubes from the U.S. and India, as well as an investigation into Dupont China Group, a subsidiary of the U.S. firm DuPont (DD.N) , opens new tab , for alleged violation of China\\'s anti-monopoly law.\\n\\n\"The application of the export controls on these key materials plus some of these additions to the unreliable entity list reflects China\\'s growing tool-kit to retaliate in trade wars,\" said the Mercator Institute for China Studies\\' lead analyst for the economy Jacob Gunter.\\n\\nThe Chinese yuan has dropped to its lowest level in seven weeks and stock markets slumped on Thursday after Trump unveiled his reciprocal tariffs that were particularly heavy on China.\\n\\nThe line chart shows China\\'s exports to the U.S. and China\\'s imports from U.S. along with the trade balance.\\n\\nTrump has ordered the U.S. Trade Representative to determine whether China was living up to its commitments under the 2020 \"phase 1\" U.S.-China trade agreement by April 1.\\n\\nThe deal required China to increase purchases of U.S exports by $200 billion over a two-year period, but Beijing failed to meet its targets when the COVID-19 pandemic struck.\\n\\nChina bought $154 billion in U.S goods in 2017, before the trade war began, Chinese customs data shows, and that figure rose to $164 billion last year.\\n\\n\"I used to buy some American products, but if the price increases I might buy less,\" said Huang Zhe, 24, who works in China\\'s luxury sector.\\n\\nReporting by Mei Mei Chu, Liz Lee, Ethan Wang, Shi Bu and Xiuhao Chen; additional reporting by Liz Lee and Ella Cao in Beijing, Nicoco Chan in Shanghai, Naveen Thukral in Singapore and Ben Blanchard in Taipei; editing by Ryan Woo, Mark Heinrich, Alex Richardson and Hugh Lawson\\n\\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab',\n",

Gen. Timothy Haugh, who also heads U.S. Cyber Command, was let go along with his civilian deputy at the NSA, Wendy Noble, according to the officials. Like others in this report, they spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel moves.\\n\\nFar-right activist Laura Loomer advocated for the firings during a meeting with President Donald Trump on Wednesday, she confirmed to The Washington Post on Thursday evening.\\n\\nIn the meeting, Loomer, a fervent Trump supporter, pressed for the dismissals of a number of officials besides Haugh and Noble — in particular, National Security Council staff whose views she saw as disloyal to the president.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAt least five key National Security Council aides were fired Thursday.\\n\\n“NSA Director Tim Haugh and his deputy Wendy Noble have been disloyal to President Trump,” Loomer said in a post on X early Friday. “That is why they have been fired.”\\n\\nLoomer told The Post that she urged Trump to dismiss Haugh because he was “handpicked” by Gen. Mark A.

       "  'text': 'NEW DELHI — As President Donald Trump was sworn in for a second term, Indian officials put a plan in motion to sidestep his promised trade war — launching high-level trade talks with their American counterparts, pledging new investments in U.S. energy and defense, and unilaterally slashing tariffs on key goods.\\n\\nIn the end, it made no difference.\\n\\nIndia will be hit with a 26 percent tariff, Trump announced Wednesday, delivering a sharp blow to a country that relies heavily on U.S. export markets and is already gripped by economic stagnation. As other nations consider retaliatory measures, India has opted for restraint, still hoping to seal a broader trade agreement that might eventually deliver relief.\\n\\nIn a statement Thursday, India’s Commerce Ministry said it was “carefully examining the implications,” while emphasizing ongoing discussions over a “mutually beneficial” deal. Others in the country tried to find a silver lining, noting that some Asian competitors will face even higher rates.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBut “there is no denying it — there will be a significant impact,” said Ajay Shah, an Indian economist who previously consulted for the Finance Ministry.\\n\\nThe pressure from Washington has reignited a long-standing debate in India over whether to open up its heavily protectionist economy. Some economists see the tariff squeeze as an opportunity to push through politically fraught trade liberalization. Others warn that India’s midsize and labor-intensive industries can’t afford the shock.\\n\\nWith no immediate respite in sight, exporters here are bracing for the fallout.\\n\\nBad timing\\n\\nThe effects may be most acute in the emerging smartphone market in India, which is home to 15 percent of Apple’s global production. The United States is also a vital market for Indian jewelry and agricultural exports, including shrimp, basmati rice and honey.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nExemptions given to pharmaceuticals offered relief to one of India’s most U.S.-dependent industries, and analysts said higher tariffs on regional rivals including China, Vietnam and Bangladesh could give India new export opportunities.\\n\\nBut the relative advantage will only matter if India institutes structural reforms, economists said. India has struggled to attract manufacturers looking to pivot away from China, partly because of high tariffs on required components. And other peer nations, including Malaysia, the Philippines and Brazil, could cut into any potential competitive edge.\\n\\nIndia’s economy is struggling. Private investment and consumer spending are flat, and gross domestic product is predicted to grow at its slowest pace in years. “The timing is bad,” said Rajat Kathuria, an economics professor and dean at Shiv Nadar University. “Really bad.”\\n\\n‘Time to do something big’\\n\\nUntil the last moment, India remained hopeful it could stave off the tariff hikes. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal made multiple visits to Washington to engage with American officials, while assistant U.S. trade representative Brendan Lynch spent several days negotiating in New Delhi.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIndia unveiled a series of preemptive goodwill measures, reducing tariffs on some cars, motorcycles, electronics, solar components, chemicals and alcohol. It also proposed eliminating what is referred to as the “Google tax” on online advertisements, which Shah called a clear “olive branch.”\\n\\n“India’s response is the most feeble because it is the weakest economy in the [Group of 20] and has the most to lose,” Kathuria said.\\n\\nThe U.S. is India’s largest trading partner, accounting for almost a fifth of its exports, resulting in a trade surplus of almost $46 billion in 2024.\\n\\nIndia has long been one of the world’s most protectionist countries, only opening up its economy in the 1990s to avert a financial crisis. In 2023, India’s average tariff (not accounting for trade deals) stood at 17 percent, nearly six times the average U.S. rate, according to the World Trade Organization.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIn 2019, Trump revoked India’s preferential trade status, prompting retaliatory tariffs from New Delhi. Subsequent trade talks faltered, with concessions offered by New Delhi viewed as insufficient by the first Trump administration, according to Mark Linscott, an early U.S. negotiator.\\n\\nTrump has repeatedly singled out India for its high tariffs, including during a recent news conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi — underscoring the limits of the nationalist leaders’ ideological alignment.\\n\\n“Now we have a situation where the leverage being deployed is even more serious,” Linscott said. “A successful bilateral is long overdue.”\\n\\nBoth sides have set a fall deadline for a trade deal. Two people familiar with the situation, speaking on the condition of anonymity to share sensitive details, said Trump’s planned visit to India is contingent on its success.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWashington has made it clear that it expects India to implement sweeping trade liberalization, according to the two people, especially in agriculture.\\n\\n“It’s time to do something big, something grand,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said last month, speaking virtually at an event in New Delhi. “Not product by product, but rather the whole thing.”\\n\\nReform or retaliate?\\n\\nFor some economists, the U.S. pressure represents a welcome and overdue catalyst for domestic reform.\\n\\n“We have to reduce tariffs,” Kathuria said. “This is an opportunity for India to do something that it always wants to do, and has wanted to do, but is politically difficult to do. ”\\n\\nThe Modi government has signaled it is inching in this direction. In March, the Commerce Ministry urged Indian businesses to shed their “protectionist mindset.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe challenge, Kathuria said, is that “the entire government seems to be captured by industry,” and Modi will probably be wary of alienating business leaders.\\n\\nShah is more optimistic, saying Modi has a rare opportunity to cast difficult changes as an essential jump-start. “We can’t change the U.S.; it is deeply messed up,” he said. “But a huge pro-globalization economic initiative? There is no better policy package to revitalize an economy that has frankly struggled ever since 2011.”\\n\\nIndia is already looking beyond the U.S. as well, advancing trade negotiations with the European Union, Australia and Britain.\\n\\nOther economists warn that fast, far-reaching policy changes could ultimately backfire, exposing India’s most protected sectors, particularly agriculture, to foreign competitors.\\n\\n“If you open up the market, most domestic small enterprises will be pushed out,” said Amitendu Palit, an economist at the National University of Singapore. “The benefits will go to U.S. businesses.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAjay Srivastava, a former trade official, harked back to 2018, when India lowered trade barriers in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum and opened the floodgates to Chinese goods.\\n\\nHis advice now is blunt: “Do not look weak.” If Washington rejects India’s trade proposals, Srivastava argues, New Delhi should retaliate, following the lead of China, Canada and the E.U.\\n\\nRaghav Chadha, a leader of the opposition Aam Aadmi Party, expressed consternation Thursday in Parliament that Trump had gone ahead with the tariffs despite India’s “unflinching loyalty and undying friendship to the U.S.” He suggested the government could withhold approvals for Starlink, Elon Musk’s satellite communications company, as a “bargaining chip” in negotiations.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The Trump administration on Thursday threatened to pull federal funding from K-12 school districts and states if they don’t certify within 10 days that they do not have unlawful diversity, equity and inclusion practices.\\n\\nStates have to sign and submit a certification form asserting that each of their districts do not give advantages to people based on their race, according to a memo sent to education officials by the U.S. Department of Education. The form itself warns that states or individual schools could be subject to litigation or be forced to pay back funds if they’re found to violate the law.\\n\\nThe directive is the latest in a series of aggressive orders the Trump administration has issued through the department — which it intends to dismantle — to drag the education sector in line with conservative orthodoxy around race and gender.\\n\\n“Federal financial assistance is a privilege, not a right,” acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor said in a statement. Too many schools, Trainor asserted, use “DEI programs to discriminate against one group of Americans to favor another based on identity characteristics,” which he said violates anti-discrimination law.\\n\\nThe memo sent a “shock wave” through the education world Thursday, said Jonathan Collins, co-director of the politics and education program at Columbia University’s Teachers College. He sees the certification form as a green light to let the federal government comb through districts’ policies, curricular units and other activities to “essentially plant red flags when they see issues.”\\n\\n“This is quite unprecedented,” Collins said.\\n\\nWhile no school has lost federal funding over civil rights violations in decades — not since 1990, according to Education Week — education experts believe the Trump administration is getting closer to making that a reality for those that do not follow its directives.\\n\\nThe Education Department told Maine earlier this week that it may ask the Department of Justice this month to start the legal process of cutting federal dollars from the state’s education agency over policies regarding transgender student athletes. And federal agencies have frozen grants to Ivy League universities over accusations they have not sufficiently addressed antisemitism on campus.\\n\\n“Is this what the Trump administration calls local control?” Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, an advocacy organization, said in a statement. “You can’t say you’re giving control back to states and then dictate how they run their schools.”\\n\\nDiversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, is an umbrella term widely used in academic and workplace settings to refer to a range of activities or policies meant to level the playing field for people from historically disadvantaged backgrounds. However, critics contend DEI has been used to inappropriately boost certain students or employees based solely on their race or gender. Conservative activists began to attack DEI in recent years after accusing K-12 schools of teaching an academic concept called critical race theory.\\n\\nMichael Pillera, director of the educational opportunities project at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said even if the administration doesn’t pull funding, these directives will likely cause educators to back away from lawful activities to avoid creating a target for the Trump administration.\\n\\n“The letter in no way changed the law,” said Pillera, who worked in the department’s civil rights office until he resigned last month. “All that changed is the department’s behavior and its desire to intimidate and chill activities and school districts.”\\n\\nStates and schools already have to agree that they will not violate federal civil rights laws if they accept federal funding under Title I, which helps schools with high numbers of impoverished students. The new form attempts to go further, drawing on an earlier directive from the department, sent Feb. 14, that gave schools 14 days to stop using race in admissions, hiring, financial aid, discipline, grading and other aspects of school life.\\n\\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and the National Education Association are suing the department, arguing that the Feb. 14 letter oversteps the government’s legal authority and threatens educators’ First Amendment rights. The case is still pending, and the department asked this week for an extension until April 11 to file a response, according to court records.\\n\\nThe Education Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Thursday’s memo referred to a frequently asked questions document it issued in February that elaborated on potential violations of anti-discrimination laws. It said the department would consider the facts and circumstances of each case to determine violations, and balance those concerns against First Amendment protections.\\n\\nLiz King, senior director of education policy at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, an advocacy group, said the latest directive could become a “gotcha game” where violations are decided based on how they comport with Trump’s agenda, rather than legal precedent.\\n\\n“Of course there’s a deadline,” King said. “This is only the latest fire drill in a campaign of chaos and fear.”',\n",

Kennedy Jr. said the layoffs represented \"a difficult moment for all of us\" but that \"we must shift course\" because Americans are \"getting sicker every year.\"\\n\\nAn official at the National Institutes of Health with knowledge on the matter, who asked not to be named, told ABC News that the layoffs were an \"HHS-wide bloodbath,\" with entire offices being fired.\\n\\nSources told ABC News that affected offices included a majority of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\'s Office on Smoking and Health, key offices in the Center for Tobacco Products, most of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and the entire assisted reproductive technology team at the CDC.\\n\\nThen, Kennedy told ABC News on Thursday that some programs would soon be reinstated because they were mistakenly cut.\\n\\nIn a video statement posted on X prior to the layoffs, Kennedy said that he plans to bring to the agency a \"clear sense of mission to radically improve the health of Americans and to improve agency morale.\"\\n\\nIn the six-minute clip, Kennedy claimed that the U.S. is the \"sickest nation in the world,\" with rates of chronic disease and cancer increasing dramatically and the lifespan of Americans dropping -- though Kennedy did not present any data in his video to support those claims.\\n\\nSmoking and the use of tobacco products contribute to both chronic disease and cancer -- and the offices tackling those issues are among those that were gutted in Kennedy\\'s recent moves.\\n\\nWhile Kennedy is correct in his statement that some chronic disease and cancer rates have risen, public health experts said -- and data shows -- that the country has made great progress tackling illnesses, including driving down cancer mortality rates, and that life expectancy is on the rise.\\n\\n\"Gutting the public health system while claiming to fight disease is a dangerous contradiction,\" said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist and chief innovation officer at Boston Children\\'s Hospital, as well as a contributor for ABC News.\\n\\n\"We should be focusing on strengthening – not stripping – the public health system if we\\'re serious about tackling chronic disease,\" Brownstein continued. \"Dismantling key infrastructure will only set us back in the fight to keep Americans healthy.\"\\n\\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

After a devastating pandemic, life expectancy is beginning to rise again.\"\\n\\nBetween 2022 and 2023, age-adjusted death rates decreased for nine of the leading causes of death in the U.S., according to a December 2024 report from the CDC.\\n\\nThis includes decreasing death rates from heart disease, unintentional injuries, stroke, chronic lower respiratory diseases, Alzheimer\\'s disease, diabetes, kidney disease, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, and COVID-19.\\n\\nAdditionally, age-specific death rates dropped from 2022 to 2023 for all age groups ages 5 and older, the CDC report found.\\n\\nThe report also found life expectancy in the U.S. is beginning to rise again after it dropped in every U.S. state during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nLife expectancy in 2023 hit its highest level since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the CDC report. Data showed life expectancy for the U.S. population was 78.4 years in 2023, an increase of 0.9 years from 2022.\\n\\nThe drop in age-adjusted death rates was largely attributed to decreases in mortality from COVID-19, heart disease, unintentional injuries and diabetes.\\n\\n\"Claims that Americans are getting sicker every year simply don\\'t hold up,\" Brownstein told ABC News. \"Life expectancy is rising again post-pandemic, and we\\'ve seen declines in cancer, cardiovascular and overdose mortality.\"\\n\\nObesity rising in children, decreasing in adults\\n\\nKennedy has said he wants to tackle the obesity epidemic, including childhood obesity.\\n\\nResearch does show that obesity is rising in children in the U.S. and is occurring at younger ages, with approximately one in five children and teens in the U.S. having obesity, according to the CDC.\\n\\nA 2022 study from Emory University that studied data from 1998 through 2016 found that childhood obesity among kindergarten through fifth-grade students has become more severe, putting more children at risk of health consequences.\\n\\nHowever, Jha pointed out in his post on X that \"even obesity rates have plateaued and are beginning to turn down\" in adults.\\n\\nFor the first time in over a decade, adult obesity rates in the U.S. may be trending downward, with numbers dropping slightly from 46% in 2022 to 45.6% in 2023, according to a study published in JAMA Health Forum in December 2024.\\n\\nThe study reviewed the body mass index, a generally accepted method of estimating obesity, of 16.7 million U.S. adults over a 10-year period. The average BMI rose annually during that period to 30.24, which is considered obese, until it plateaued in 2022, then dropped marginally to 30.21 in 2023.\\n\\n\"Recent research I co-authored in JAMA shows that obesity rates in adults have plateaued and are even starting to trend downward,\" said Brownstein, a co-author of the study. \"That progress reflects the very kind of long-term public health investment this reorg puts at risk.\"\\n\\nChronic disease on the rise\\n\\nKennedy has made tackling chronic diseases a cornerstone of his \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform.\\n\\nOver the past two decades, the prevalence of chronic conditions has been steadily increasing, according to a 2024 study conducted by researchers in Iowa, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Texas.\\n\\nSignage for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) headquarters is seen on April 02, 2025 in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\\n\\n\"An increasing proportion of people in America are dealing with multiple chronic conditions; 42% have [two] or more, and 12% have at least [five],\" the authors wrote.\\n\\nHowever, the study also found that the prevalence of chronic disease varies by geographic location and socioeconomic status. Residents who live in areas with the highest prevalence of chronic disease also face a number of contributing social, economic and environmental barriers, the study found.\\n\\nA 2022 study from the CDC found chronic diseases linked to cigarette smoking include respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, as well as cancers and diabetes.\\n\\nRates of cancer have \\'increased dramatically\\'\\n\\nKennedy is correct in stating that cancer rates in the U.S. have increased, with incidence rates rising for 17 cancer types in younger generations, according to a 2024 joint study from the American Cancer Society, Cancer Care Alberta and the University of Calgary.\\n\\nThere has been a notable increase in incidence rates for many cancer types among women and younger adults, research shows.\\n\\nIncidence rates among women between ages 50 and 64 have surpassed those among men, according to a 2025 report published in the journal of the American Cancer Society.\\n\\nAdditionally, cancer rates among women under age 50 are 82% higher than among men under age 50, which is up from 51% in 2002, the report found.\\n\\nHowever, while cancer incidence has increased, cancer mortality has decreased.\\n\\nA 2025 report from the American Cancer Society found that age-adjusted cancer death rates have dropped from a peak in 1991 by 34% as of 2022, largely due to reductions in smoking, advances in treatment and early detection for some cancers.\\n\\nHowever, there is more work to be done and disparities still persist. For example, Native Americans have the highest cancer death rates of any racial or ethnic group in the U.S.\\n\\nAdditionally, Black Americans have a two-fold higher mortality rate than white Americans for prostate, stomach and uterine corpus cancers, the latter of which is a cancer of the lining of the uterus.\\n\\nDr. Jay-Sheree Allen Akambase is a family medicine and preventive medicine physician at the Mayo Clinic and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.\\n\\nABC News\\' Dr. Niki Iranpour, Cheyenne Haslett and Will McDuffie contributed to this report.',\n",

       "  'text': 'CNN —\\n\\nA Michigan couple was released Thursday after spending nearly a month in a Mexican prison over a payment dispute with a timeshare company, according to Michael Gordon, a spokesperson for Michigan Rep. Tom Barrett’s office.\\n\\nPaul Akeo, a 58-year-old Navy veteran, and his wife Christy, 60, were taken into custody shortly after their plane landed in Cancun on March 4, according to their family.\\n\\nProsecutors in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, where Cancun is located, had accused the Akeos of defrauding a hospitality company. The couple was released and their criminal charges were dismissed after they reached a reparation agreement with the company, prosecutors said in a statement Thursday.\\n\\nAs part of the agreement, the couple agreed to pay for damages which would then be distributed to three non-profit organizations, according to prosecutors.\\n\\nThe case stems from a 2021 timeshare agreement between the Akeos and Palace Elite, a subsidiary of The Palace Company, John Manly, an attorney for the Akeo family, previously told CNN.\\n\\nThe couple’s family has said the allegations against them are false. Through their attorneys, the Akeos say they successfully disputed charges with their credit card from a resort company they claim breached their contract by failing to provide services.\\n\\nThe couple arrived back in the US overnight Thursday, according to video from CNN affiliate WILX.\\n\\n“We had no access to phones, internet,” Paul Akeo said of conditions inside the prison where they were held. The couple, speaking after they arrived in the US, added they were even cut off from each other for roughly a week.\\n\\n“They told you what to do and when to do it,” Christy Akeo said, noting the difficulty they had overcoming the language barrier when they needed to ask Mexican authorities for help.\\n\\nBoth emphasized their gratitude for the outpouring of support from US officials. “I don’t even know how we’re going to repay or thank people,” Christy said.\\n\\nEarlier the couple’s attorney thanked Congressman Barrett, calling him a “hero in my book,” as well as Special Envoy Adam Boehler and President Donald Trump.\\n\\n“President Trump, I know he personally got involved with this and wanted them home, so I give him a lot of credit,” Manly said to CNN Thursday night. “No American should have to endure what these people have endured. But for these three men, I think they’d still be sitting there.”\\n\\nIn a statement, Lindsey Hull and Michael Lemke thanked government officials for helping to secure their parents’ release, specifically highlighting Rep. Barrett’s commitment.\\n\\n“He traveled to Cancun at great personal risk, camped out at the prison and made it clear that he would not return home without them,” they said in the Thursday statement. “His heroic efforts as a veteran represent the finest traditions of our nation’s military to never leave an American behind.”\\n\\n“No American should be held hostage to the demands of a private company anywhere in the world,” they said.\\n\\nHull and Lemke added that their parents will be treated for “illnesses and trauma inflicted upon them during their captivity.”\\n\\nIn a Thursday statement, a spokesperson for The Palace Company also thanked Trump, Barrett and Boehler for their mediation efforts.\\n\\n“The Palace Company and the Akeos agree that $116,587.84, the amount that was contested by the Akeos and refunded to them by American Express, will be donated to a bona fide established nonprofit in Mexico benefiting orphan children,” the spokesperson said. “Each party regrets that this incident occurred.”\\n\\nManly told CNN in a March statement that the couple was being “held captive in a hell hole of a Mexican maximum-security prison.”\\n\\nBarrett decried the prison’s “horrific conditions” on X after he visited the couple there on Wednesday.\\n\\nHull previously told CNN she was concerned about her parents’ health in prison.\\n\\n“Their lives are in danger. Their health is declining. We need to get these people home,” Hull said, referring to her parents. “We just don’t have another option. They’re not going to be sitting in prison indefinitely.”\\n\\nThe US State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the couple’s release. A State Department spokesperson previously told CNN it’s “aware of reports of the detention of two U.S. citizens in Mexico” but declined to offer specifics.\\n\\nHull said last month her parents were taken into custody and told arrest warrants had been issued for them in Mexico after a criminal complaint was filed by The Palace Company alleging fraud.\\n\\n“We’re assuming it has something to do with the timeshare with Palace Resorts,” she recalled her stepfather telling her in a call the day her parents were arrested.\\n\\nHow the case unfolded\\n\\nProsecutors in Mexico \\ufeffalleged in a March 15 statement that in 2022, the Akeos canceled 13 credit card payments to a hotel chain totaling more than $116,500. Prosecutors did not elaborate on possible evidence but said the activity constitutes fraud.\\n\\nThrough their attorneys, the Akeos say Palace failed to provide promised services a few months into their timeshare contract. The couple then filed a complaint with their credit card company seeking a refund of nearly $117,000 in Palace payments.\\n\\nThe couple argued the resort company breached their contract. Manly said in a statement last week the Akeos were held “because they successfully disputed Palace’ (sic) charges and failure to deliver services with American Express, criticized the Company on Facebook and alerted others who felt wronged by Palace.”\\n\\nManly added the company was retaliating against the couple for challenging the charges.\\n\\nA spokesperson for The Palace Company and attorneys for the Akeos both provided CNN with documentation showing an extended dispute about the couple’s use of membership benefits and what could be considered breaches of contract.\\n\\nThe Palace spokesperson told CNN in statements last week that they filed a complaint with Mexican authorities in August 2023 after the Akeos “fraudulently disputed legitimate credit card charges and publicly encouraged others to do the same.”\\n\\n“The Akeos began disputing their membership charges with their credit card companies,” Palace said in a statement last week. “These disputes – despite relating to services they had actively used – were granted,” the company said in a statement.\\n\\nPalace claims the couple later took to Facebook and “bragged about these chargebacks and encouraged others to follow suit.”\\n\\nLast September, attorneys for Palace sent a cease-and-desist letter to Christy Akeo claiming that her Facebook posts were unlawful because she had instructed members on how to end their agreements “using illegal and fraudulent means,” according to a copy of the letter the company provided to CNN.\\n\\nSeparately, in announcing the fraud charges last month, Mexican prosecutors pointed to social media posts, alleging Christy Akeo used them “to inform how said fraud was committed against the hotel chain.”\\n\\nPalace previously said it also filed a related civil suit seeking financial damages and that “all of its actions are in full accordance with Mexican law.”\\n\\n“The bottom line is this is a civil dispute which can be easily litigated,” Manly told CNN in a Friday statement. “Palace has no right to force a settlement by having the Akeos arrested and thrown into a dangerous Mexican prison.”\\n\\nHull previously told CNN her family received no notice of criminal charges that she is aware of and said her mother did take to social media to share her negative experience with fellow Palace patrons. However, she’s baffled at why social media activity may have contributed to the arrest.\\n\\n“My mom was very clear about that in this Facebook group where people were seeking information on what to do when you get in these memberships,” Hull said. “If there’s 8,000 people dealing with the same thing, and the same disappointments with Palace Resorts, and how they treat their members, maybe you should look in the mirror and make a change.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON (AP) — After a long wait, the Senate is launching action on President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” of tax breaks and spending cuts at a risky moment for the U.S. and global economy.\\n\\nMore than a month after House Republicans surprised Washington by advancing their framework for Trump’s $4.5 trillion in tax breaks and $2 trillion in spending cuts, Senate Republicans voted Thursday to start working on their version. The largely party-line vote, 52-48, sets the stage for a potential Senate all-nighter Friday spilling into the weekend.\\n\\nBut work on the multitrillion-dollar package is coming as markets at home and abroad are on edge in the aftermath Trump’s vast tariffs scheme, complicating an already difficult political and procedural undertaking on what Republicans hope will become their signature domestic policy package.\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., opened the chamber Thursday saying they expected to be ready to begin.\\n\\nTrump says he’s on board with the plan and Republicans, in control of Congress, are eager to show the party is making progress toward delivering on their campaign promises. By nightfall, as voting began, one Republican, the libertarian-leaning Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, voted against, as did all Democrats.\\n\\nDemocrats, as the minority party, don’t have the votes to stop the GOP plan. But they intend to use the procedural tools available to prolong the process. Democrats argue that Republicans are focusing on tax breaks for the wealthy at the expense of the programs and services millions of Americans rely on for help with health care, child care, school lunches and other everyday needs.\\n\\n“They’re mean, they’re nasty, they’re uncaring,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said about the Republicans. “We, tonight and tomorrow, are going to show just who they are.”\\n\\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., from left, and Sen.

Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Budget committee, repeated a slogan he has been sharing: “Families lose and billionaires win.”\\n\\n“That,” he said, “is the Republican plan.”\\n\\nFundamental to the Senate package is making sure Trump’s first-term tax cuts, which are set to expire at the end of the year, are continued and made a permanent fixture of the tax code. The senators also will consider adding Trump’s proposed tax cuts on tipped wages, Social Security income and others.\\n\\nThe Senate package also would bolster border security funds by some $175 billion to carry out Trump’s mass deportation campaign, which is running short of cash, and it would add national security funds for the Pentagon — all priorities the Senate GOP tucked into an earlier version that was panned by House Republicans.\\n\\nRepublican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the party whip, said that without action tax cuts would expire, becoming a $4 trillion tax hike on Americans. “Republicans are focused on getting America back on track,” he said.\\n\\nWhat’s unclear is how it will all be paid for, since Republican deficit hawks typically require spending offsets to help defray the lost tax revenue and avoid piling onto the nation’s $36 trillion debt load.\\n\\nWhile House Republicans approved their package with $4.5 trillion in tax breaks and up to $2 trillion in spending cuts, the Senate Republicans are taking a different tack.\\n\\nSenate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham is making the case that since the existing Trump tax breaks are the current policy, they are not considered new, and do not need to be offset with reductions in spending — an approach Democrats compare to “going nuclear” with the normal rules, particularly if the strategy is put to the test with an unfavorable ruling before the Senate parliamentarian.\\n\\nInstead, Senate Republicans are considering offsets mostly for any new Trump tax breaks. Raising alarms from the most conservative budget hawks, the senators have set a floor of about $4 billion in budget reductions to health and other programs — a fraction of the package’s expected $4 trillion-plus price tag for tax breaks.\\n\\nGOP leaders are assuring the deficit hawks within their own ranks that the legislation says the cuts can rise to as much as $2 trillion.\\n\\nAfter an expected Friday night vote-a-rama, with dozens of amendments being offered to the package, the senators are planning to stay into Saturday if needed to take a final vote to approve it, sending it to the House for action.\\n\\nThe House and Senate will ultimately need to merge their frameworks into a final product, expected in May, but House Speaker Mike Johnson’s intention to have it all wrapped up by Memorial Day could prove optimistic.\\n\\nThe political environment is uncertain, and the public’s appetite for steep budget cuts is being tested in real time, with Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency headed by billionaire Elon Musk blazing through federal offices, firing thousands of workers and shuttering long-running government mainstays — from scientific research projects on diseases to educational services for schoolchildren to offices that help with Social Security, tax filing and the weather.\\n\\nAt the same time, the staunchest fiscal conservatives in both the House and Senate, many aligned with the Freedom Caucus, are pushing for even more cuts.\\n\\nTrump told senators publicly and privately this week he would have their backs, particularly when it comes to standing up for the spending reductions. At a White House announcing the tariffs Wednesday, Trump said the Senate plan had his “complete and total support.”\\n\\nThe president’s steep tariffs threw the global economy into a tailspin Thursday, with stocks down around the world, the U.S. markets leading the way.\\n\\n__\\n\\nAssociated Press writers Leah Askarinam and Kevin Freking contributed to this report.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Israel-Turkey tensions escalate over Syria\\n\\n39 minutes ago Share Save Lucy Williamson BBC Middle East correspondent Share Save\\n\\nEPA Israel has repeatedly carried out air strikes on Syrian bases since the fall of Assad\\n\\nA growing confrontation between Israel and Turkey over influence in Syria is posing a serious challenge for Syria\\'s fragile new government. On Wednesday night, Israel bombed several military targets in Syria, including two airports – Hama military airport and the T4 base near Homs. Syria\\'s foreign ministry said the bombardment virtually destroyed the Hama base. A prominent Syrian human rights group said four defence ministry employees were killed, and a dozen other people injured. The air strikes hit Syria, but their real target was Turkey. Shortly afterwards, Israel\\'s foreign minister accused Turkey of playing a \"negative role\" in Syria, and Israel\\'s defence minister warned Syria\\'s interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, that he would \"pay a very heavy price\" if he allowed \"hostile forces\" to enter his country. Ankara is currently negotiating a joint defence pact with Sharaa\\'s new government, and there have been widespread reports that Turkey is moving to station aircraft and air defence systems at Syria\\'s T4 and Aleppo airbases.\\n\\nSome analysts compared Israel\\'s intense air strikes on Hama airport this week with the much lighter bombing on the edge of the T4 base, suggesting that Turkey may have already moved some equipment there and that Israel was calibrating its attack to avoid a full-blown escalation. Relations between Israel and Turkey have nose-dived since the Gaza war began in October 2023, with Ankara introducing trade restrictions and accusing Israel of genocide. That regional tension is now playing out on new ground in Syria. After the air strikes on Wednesday, Turkey\\'s foreign ministry accused Israel of destabilising the region by \"both causing chaos and feeding terrorism\" and said it was now the greatest threat to the security of the region. But foreign minister Hakan Fidan told Reuters news agency that his country was not seeking confrontation with Israel, and that Syria could set its own policies with its southern neighbour.\\n\\nSyria\\'s new leader has repeatedly signalled that he was not looking for confrontation with Israel. Soon after sweeping President Bashar al-Assad from power last December, he told the BBC that Syria would not pose a threat to any country. He has even left the door open to normalising diplomatic relations with Israel in the future, telling the Economist last month that Syria wanted peace with all parties, but that it was too early to discuss such a sensitive issue. His top priority since taking power has been to unite a bitterly divided Syria, and pacify external relations with its neighbours, while he cements his power and control. But Israel has not made that easy. Its military interventions in Syria are fuelling conflict with both external powers like Turkey, and with internal groups like jihadists in the country\\'s south. Once an implacable enemy of Syria\\'s former president and his Iranian ally, Israel is also suspicious of Sharaa, a man who once led the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda and whose new government is backed by Turkey. Since he took power, Israel\\'s military has repeatedly pounded Syrian weapons stores, airfields and other military sites left by the former regime, to avoid them falling into enemy hands, it says. It has also occupied a demilitarised buffer zone, set up after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, and has sent forces onto the Syrian side of a nearby mountain, setting up nine bases across the area. Israeli troops are also making regular incursions into Syria\\'s south-western provinces, vowing to prevent the presence of any armed groups or government forces there. Earlier this week, the local government in the southern city of Deraa said nine civilians were killed in an Israeli bombardment, during the deepest incursion there yet by Israeli forces. Another four people were killed in Israeli shelling near the village of Koya late last month, after local gunmen tried to stop the advance of Israeli forces there. Since then, mosques in both Deraa and Damascus have reportedly called for jihad against Israeli forces.

       "  'text': 'The global tariff rout deepened Friday, with the Nasdaq dropping as much as 5% after China\\'s decision to match U.S. duties escalated the worst trade war in decades.\\n\\nChina\\'s decision to apply 34% levies on all imported goods from the U.S. next Thursday, after President Trump\\'s tariffs go into effect, rattled markets in part because it further deflated hopes on Wall Street that a global settlement could be reached soon.\\n\\nNow investors are bracing for further conflict—none of which is likely to improve the outlook for the global economy or corporate profits, the strongest driver of stock prices. JPMorgan analysts on Thursday boosted their odds on a global recession to 60%.\\n\\nTrump remained unbowed, saying now is a \"great time to get rich\" and that \"China played it wrong, they panicked.\"\\n\\nThe torrent of selling late this week shows investors coming to grips with the grim implications of the largest tariff increase in nearly a century. The levies announced late Wednesday were deeper and more aggressive than the business world expected. Even as Trump left the door open to making deals, he vowed new tariffs on drugs and microchips. Investors took little comfort from Trump\\'s stated willingness to negotiate.\\n\\nMarco Rubio, the secretary of state, acknowledged that \"markets are crashing\" but said economies weren\\'t, and that global businesses would adjust to the new environment.\\n\\nInvestors drew little solace from an unexpectedly strong jobs report. That showed the economy added 228,000 jobs last month, giving little sign that uncertainty ahead of the tariff rollout had derailed the labor market.\\n\\nOn Friday, major U.S. indexes opened sharply lower before staging a modest recovery late in the morning. The Dow dropped 1000 points after earlier being off by 1400. The Nasdaq Composite was down 3% and on pace to close in a bear market, meaning it has fallen more than 20% from a recent peak. Overseas markets took fresh hits, with European stocks tumbling more than 4%.\\n\\nTraders have ramped up bets on interest-rate cuts this year, figuring the Federal Reserve will have to shore up the economy. Oil prices slid further, with benchmark U.S. crude falling to about $62 a barrel, the lowest level since 2021 if they settle there.\\n\\nInvestors rushed into Treasurys, pushing 10-year yields well below 4%. Bonds in other big economies, like Japan, Germany and the U.K., also rallied. Bond yields fall as prices rise. The dollar, which fell sharply Thursday, rebounded somewhat but remains near its weakest levels of the year.',\n",

       "  'text': 'It’s just two days since Donald Trump launched his extraordinary tariff assault on the world in a bid to rebuild the US economy and roll back an era of globalization. But already shopkeepers are bracing for recession, and their customers spending less, as they prepare to increase prices.\\n\\n“We’re going to have to put our prices up and people aren’t going to like it,” said Ian Anderson, store manager at Tea and Sympathy, a UK grocery store, restaurant and fish-and-chip shop stalwart in Manhattan’s West Village.\\n\\nBusiness costs have already increased significant, he noted. But tariffs would add to the load. “We’ve survived so far because we sell base products – cakes, scones, hot cross buns, mince pies. If it was just imports, we’d struggle.”\\n\\nMost retailers in the New York neighborhood agreed on one thing: the tariffs announced this week would contribute to business environment anxieties that have been mounting for years, from the 2008 economic crisis, to the initial wave of tariffs under Trump’s first administration, the Covid pandemic and the high inflation that followed.\\n\\nBut many also said it was too soon to tell if Trump’s tariffs would ultimately go into effect – or if they were just the opening salvo of his latest shock-and-awe style of dealmaking. A day earlier, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, encouraged countries around the world to refrain from retaliating against the US.\\n\\nFor businesses that rely on wealthy downtown residents and visitors to the city, prices of imported goods had already been rising. A 10% levy on UK imports, 20% on other European imports, and a patchwork of numbers on other countries will not help at all, according to Jennifer Pulidore, the owner of Myers of Keswick, a family business selling British groceries for four decades.\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Jennifer Pulidore, the owner of Myers of Keswick, at her West Village shop. Photograph: Ed Helmore\\n\\n“The price of chocolate has gone up astronomically,” she said. “Our Easter order was over £7,000 [$9,100] more compared to last year and we didn’t grossly increase the quantities,” Pulidore said. Myer’s imports broker hadn’t yet estimated what the new tariffs would cost, but Pulidore doubts that customers will accept $2 more on a $16 box of chocolates.\\n\\nCustomers, she said, are already questioning why shortcake originally marked at £2.25 was already $6.95. Customers, she said, sometimes question the mark-up. “Well, do you not consider we are in New York City and we pay New York City rent? Our employees don’t work for free. And I have to pay that price, and then get it over here.”\\n\\nMyers is celebrating 40 years in business in July. Pulidore’s father, Peter Myers, has retired back to Cumbria. Pulidore thinks about the future of the business “all the time”.\\n\\nTrump argues that his plan – however disruptive – will create American jobs and trigger a vast windfall for the country, despite many economists’ warnings. “I get that,” said Pulidore’s. “But the implementation – the ways he’s gone about it – is just awful. I’m definitely worried about a recession, and people spending less.”\\n\\nAt a clothing store, a Canadian customer on his way back to Toronto arrived to return goods because he didn’t want to pay 25% retaliatory duties going into Canada. The store offered to ship and label the items as gifts, thereby avoiding the duties. “It’s scary times,” offered a sales assistant. “Like, wasn’t the first time scary enough with Trump? Why do we have to do this again?”\\n\\nNearby, having her picture taken in front of Carrie Bradshaw’s fictional Sex and the City townhouse, was Siobhan Copeland and her son, visiting from London. Fears about coming through customs at JFK a day earlier had proved unfounded.\\n\\n“I was a bit apprehensive, but he just asked me to pronounce my name, so it was all good,” Copeland said. But she was hopeful about the tariff conflict, because the UK appeared to have a “slightly better relationship with the US than Europe now that we’re separated. But who knows what’s to come? I think we just have to go with it. It’s either going to happen or it isn’t, right?\\n\\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If it gets to 50% then we’ll see. We’re not really sure if the manufacturers themselves will try to do something and so everybody takes a bit of the hit.”\\n\\nThe West Village, of course, is largely a destination shop for high-end items – Diptyque candles and European handbags, so not necessarily representative of the overall effects of the sweeping tariffs unveiled on Wednesday.\\n\\nAnderson has been taking the temperature of customers at Tea and Sympathy. “The main feeling is that [Trump] is completely bonkers,” he said. On a recent trip home to England, “nobody wanted to know anything else about America except Donald Trump”.\\n\\nHis business is about to experience the full effects of the tariffs, as it rebuilds outside dining sheds permitted by New York City authorities over the next few weeks. Anderson’s contractor was already warning before the latest round of tariffs that building materials, mostly from China, would put the cost at around $80,000.\\n\\nThe bitter irony of tariff wars, store owner Hakim at Waverly Wines & Spirits on Sixth Avenue pointed out, is that prices don’t necessarily go down if the tariffs are lifted. He pointed to a bottle of Lagavulin Scotch whisky priced at $115.99. Prior to Trump’s 25% tariffs during his first term, the bottle was $75.\\n\\n“We’ve still never recovered from that,” he said. “Scotch prices went up but they never went down when the tariffs were removed. So prices go up for a reason, and you take that reason away, and they rarely go down. Same with oil and gas. They always use the same tactics.”',\n",

What’s more, over periods of 10 to 20 years or more, stocks have always bounced back handily after downturns, leaving investors who remained steadfast with far bigger balances than they had before the turmoil.\\n\\nBut what if you don’t have a decade or more to wait out a recovery?\\n\\nFor anyone who intends to leave the work force in the next few years or who has recently retired, the current financial environment is perilous. If you’re still working, a recession could push you out of a job earlier than planned, cutting short the time you have left to save and extending the period you need those savings to last. And for both near and recent retirees, a big drop in stock prices increases the risk you’ll eventually run out of savings.\\n\\n“What happens to the market and the economy in those near and early retirement years matters disproportionately to the success of your entire retirement plan,” said Wade Pfau, a professor at the American College of Financial Services and author of “Retirement Planning Guidebook.”',\n",

Estimates ranged from 50,000 to 185,000. Part of the rise in payrolls was a rebound after freezing temperatures curbed activity in January and February.\\n\\nPayrolls were also boosted by the return of about 10,000 striking supermarket workers. The healthcare sector continued to dominate employment growth, adding 54,000 jobs in ambulatory services, hospitals as well as nursing and residential care facilities. Social assistance payrolls increased 24,000.\\n\\nRetail employment rebounded by 24,000 jobs, while transportation and warehousing added 23,000 jobs as demand for couriers and messengers as well as truck transportation workers offset warehousing and storage job losses.\\n\\nFederal government payrolls declined by only 4,000 jobs after decreasing 11,000 in February.\\n\\nTech billionaire Elon Musk\\'s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has taken a chainsaw to the public workforce as part of a radical campaign by the Trump administration to cut spending and downsize the government.\\n\\nBut courts have ordered the reinstatement of thousands of workers, while some have been put on administrative leave and others have opted for deferred resignations, making it difficult to track the job cuts.\\n\\nThe BLS said employees on paid leave or receiving ongoing severance pay are counted as employed, explaining the modest decline in federal government layoffs.\\n\\nThe dollar rose against a basket of currencies.

The unemployment rate increased to a still-relatively low 4.2% last month from 4.1% in February as more people entered the labor force.\\n\\nAverage hourly earnings gained 0.3% after climbing 0.2% in February. Annual wages increased 3.8% after rising 4.0% in February. But businesses have been hesitant to hire because of an uncertain trade policy.\\n\\nThat caution could give way to job cuts after Trump unveiled on Wednesday a 10% minimum duty on most goods imported into the U.S., which economists estimated boosted the nation\\'s effective tariff rate to the highest level in more than a century. They warned of snarled supply chains and high prices, culminating in layoffs as spending by both households and consumers retrenches.\\n\\nTrump\\'s tariffs blitz since returning to the White House has already unnerved businesses, who had cheered his electoral victory in November. Economists expect the effects of the reciprocal tariffs could be evident as soon as with April\\'s employment report. Retail payrolls are most likely to decline as consumers hunker down.\\n\\nFinancial markets expect the Federal Reserve to resume cutting interest rates no later than June after pausing its policy easing cycle in January.\\n\\nFed Chair Jerome Powell could offer fresh clues on the near-term monetary policy outlook on Friday.

       "  'publish_date': None,\n",
       "  'text': \"Unless there's a massive glitch in the universe, I have it on good authority that we can expect the Apple Watch Series 11 this September, alongside the rumored iPhone 17. Apple has consistently announced a new Apple Watch every year since its 2014 debut. Except for the first-gen model, they all launched at the yearly iPhone event in September.\\n\\nWhat's less predictable is the release date. Traditionally, the new model goes on sale anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks after the keynote (which is what we expect for 2025), though recent years have seen delays due to production issues. It's also unclear how newly imposed tariffs will affect the new watch's launch and price in 2025.\\n\\nThe Apple Watch Series 11 will follow last year's Apple Watch Series 10, which earned a CNET Editor's Choice Award. Apple sells other models too, like the Apple Watch Ultra 2, which came out in 2023 and the Apple Watch SE, which dropped in 2022. While Apple doesn't say anything about future products, we are fortunate that there are numerous rumors for all Apple Watch models. Here's what leakers and Apple analysts say we can expect for the next Apple Watch(es).\\n\\nCNET\\n\\nHow many Apple Watches will we get this year?\\n\\nWe're definitely getting a Series 11, and there's a good chance we'll see an updated Ultra and SE model, according to a report from Bloomberg's Apple analyst Mark Gurman. The Apple Watch Ultra and the cheaper SE line haven't exactly followed a predictable upgrade cycle, but last year's absence could prove a strong clue that 2025 could be the year we get all three again. The Series 10 took the spotlight in 2024 as the only smartwatch announced that year.\\n\\nJames Martin/CNET\\n\\nApple Watch design\\n\\nWith last year's redesign still fresh, the Series 11 will likely look similar to the Series 10 and feature the same large edge-to-edge screen (still 42mm and 46mm) that's brighter, lighter and thinner bezels than its predecessors. Any design tweaks would probably be minor and driven by new technology under the hood.\\n\\nAccording to MacRumors, the Apple Watch might get a more energy-efficient screen, maybe an LTPO display with higher resolution and better brightness, which, on paper, could help improve the battery life. This could be reserved for the higher-end Ultra 3, which will likely otherwise keep its original design.\\n\\nThe more adorable SE, however, could see a more extensive design overhaul. It would still have the body of the Series 8 and, according to Gurman, get several upgrades from the Series 10, like an always-on display.\\n\\nApple Watch processor\\n\\nApple typically bumps up the processor with every new smartwatch, so we should see an Apple S11 chip this time around for at least the Series 11 and Ultra 3. The Ultra 3 is also rumored to get satellite connectivity and 5G support, but according to Gurman, these features likely won't make it to the Series 11. Considering last gens' upgrade cycle, my personal bet would also be on the SE getting a processor bump up to the S9 chip, currently found in the Ultra 2 and the Apple Watch Series 9.\\n\\nThe Series 10 charges faster than earlier Apple Watches, but the battery lasts the same length of time. Celso Bulgatti/CNET\\n\\nApple Watch battery\\n\\nIf there's one thing on everyone's wishlist, it's better battery life. The Series 10 introduced faster charging -- 0% to 80% in just 30 minutes compared with 90 minutes on previous models -- but there's room for improvement in battery capacity itself.\\n\\nWhile there aren't any rumors indicating that new Apple Watches will get a longer battery life, I truly hope Apple addresses the battery because its smartwatches are falling behind. Some Android models use dual chipsets to divide tasks and optimize battery life. I'd like to see Apple adopt a similar strategy and finally push battery life to two full days on a single charge for regular models. I hope the Ultra, which currently gets a full 72 hours on a charge, gets the faster charging and pushes its battery life limits to four full days.\\n\\nApple Watch price\\n\\nBased on current pricing, the Apple Watch Series 11 could cost $399 for the 42mm aluminum version and $429 for the 46mm version, with upgrades for cover material and LTE connectivity costing extra. That is unless recently enacted tariffs play a part in pricing this year, which remains to be seen. The other question is what the most expensive variant will be -- solid gold, diamond-encrusted Hermès, anyone?\\n\\nGetty Images/Tharon Green/CNET\\n\\nApple Watch health and fitness upgrades\\n\\nThere's been a persistent rumor about blood pressure tracking finally making its way to the Apple Watch, but it's unclear when it will be ready. According to March report from Gurman, Apple has already been testing the feature in its smartwatch but has run into problems. Other wearables health companies like Omron and Med-Watch have proven it's possible to measure blood pressure from the wrist, but adding this feature would likely require new sensors and a bulkier design. It would also be less precise than dedicated health devices like Omron's and measure baseline metrics like the Galaxy Watch 7 and Ultra (which isn't supported on Samsung watches in the US).\\n\\nGlucose monitoring has also been thrown in the mix, but according to Gurman, that would be even further down the line. Lastly, the blood oxygen (SpO2) feature that debuted on the Series 6 likely won't be making a comeback this year as Apple is still navigating legal issues related to it.\\n\\nA hand with an Apple Watch activates a Level Lock Plus on a wood door. Level\\n\\nAdditional Apple Watch surprises\\n\\nThere's another rumor floating around that the Apple Watch could get a camera -- not for selfies (this isn't 2015, after all) but for AI-based image recognition. With the release of Apple Intelligence, Apple introduced a visual search tool on the iPhone that uses the camera to provide relevant information about objects and places.\\n\\nAccording to a report by Gurman, Apple is exploring this option, and even if the company decides to move forward with the technology, it likely wouldn't make its way to the Apple Watch until the 2027 models. While it's not expected for this launch, it could hint what kind of AI integration will arrive with WatchOS 12. By contrast, WatchOS 11 lacks any Apple Intelligence features.\\n\\nWatchOS 12 may also give us clues about the direction Apple is taking with Apple Intelligence on the Watch and could hint at new hardware features as well. The new operating system is expected to be unveiled at Apple's annual developers conference, WWDC 2025, which is scheduled for the week of June 5.\",\n",

       "  'publish_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 4, 4, 0, 0),\n",
       "  'text': 'It’s hard to make cancer funny. It’s almost as tricky, for different reasons, to make someone’s search for sexual fulfillment narratively compelling. FX’s “Dying for Sex” manages to do both. The limited series, co-created by Kim Rosenstock and Elizabeth Meriwether, stars Michelle Williams and Jenny Slate as real-life friends Molly Kochan, who was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer in 2015, and Nikki Boyer, who supports her right up till the end in her twin quests to explore her sexual needs and die on her own terms. Based on the popular 2020 podcast of the same name, in which the two women discussed Kochan’s sexual escapades (and leaving her 13-year marriage), the show juggles health, humor and horniness with brilliant assists from guest stars Rob Delaney, Jay Duplass, Esco Jouléy, Robby Hoffman and Sissy Spacek. It’s a weirdly good time.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIt’s almost easier to say what “Dying for Sex” isn’t than to capture what it is. Cancer carries with it certain expectations. And when your hero is a 40-something terminal patient who leaves her marriage to explore sex as a life-giving force, it takes real narrative dexterity to avoid the kind of storytelling that strains to piously represent marginalized experience or otherwise instruct. “Dying for Sex” shares with its eccentric hero a resolute and almost principled refusal to represent in this way. The story Williams and Slate deliver here isn’t a “cancer journey” in the usual sense of the term. Nor, despite the ambient feminism, is it a manifesto about female liberation. It isn’t about caretaking or trauma or expanding conventional definitions of sex, even though it capably covers all that and more. Nor, despite plenty of opportunities, does the show have much to say about our health-care system. (Molly’s medical team is largely great.)\\n\\nSkip to end of carousel The Style section Style is The Washington Post’s place for news from the front lines of culture — arts, media, politics, trends and fashion. For more Style stories, click here . To subscribe to the Style Memo newsletter, click here End of carousel\\n\\n“Dying for Sex” isn’t even, strictly speaking, about female friendship writ large. The duo at the show’s core is charming and boundaryless and so singular that their relationship becomes smeary, irreducible. Their exhausting and exhaustive approach to Molly’s plan for her life (and death) does not and cannot scale.\\n\\nThe result is tonally original; this is a first-rate comedy about dying. A sad one, as comedies go (you will weep), but a comedy nonetheless. Even the finale, which ends just as you would expect, is titled “It’s Not That Serious.” And while there’s plenty of gallows humor — the gusto with which a hospice nurse recites the stages of death, the show’s brief and savage anthropology of cancer groups (the Stage 1s want nothing to do with the Stage 4s) — the show sidesteps cynicism. And the principals are too caught up in the tragedy and hope of the moment to indulge in much social commentary.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFans of the podcast will notice minor but telling differences between the real Kochan, who died in 2019, and the show version (who I’ll refer to as Molly for the sake of clarity). Kochan had already spent years battling the disease when she was re-diagnosed and declared terminal. On the podcast, she describes receiving the call from her doctor while in a couples’ counseling session and her husband’s response to the news — a request, to their therapist, that they get back to why he’s so angry.\\n\\nKochan wasn’t especially bitter about it. “I left my husband today” is the name of her very brief blog post on the subject. (Also brief is her last entry, titled “I HAVE DIED.”) The matter-of-factness is typical. So is the lack of any prescriptive advice. She defaults toward broad-minded curiosity — about everyone, including her many hookups (and their many kinks and fetishes) but also the well-intentioned people who “dropped out” of her life as she was dying: “I realized that people are going to do whatever they’re going to do regardless of what they want to want. Even me,” she wrote in her final note.\\n\\nNeither sentimental nor saintly, Kochan is funny, and the show badly needed her humor to translate for the script to work. (It does.) The “Dying for Sex” writers preserve and sharpen some of her edges, even modifying the aforementioned scene, in which Kochan learns the cancer has metastasized, so as to make Molly less sympathetic and her husband less of a jerk. During the encounter, which is still set in a therapist’s office, Molly interrupts husband Steve’s (Jay Duplass, Duplassing like he’s never Duplassed before) monologue about how good an ally he is to his female colleagues to reiterate that she wants them to erotically reconnect now that he’s no longer her caretaker.\\n\\nWhen the doctor’s phone call interrupts the session with her diagnosis, Steve reverts immediately to that caretaker role. He’s not a jerk — he certainly doesn’t direct the therapist back to the topic of his anger — but one does sense relief. As a writing choice, this one makes clear how “Dying for Sex” works: no bad guys.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAs if to drive the point home, the show introduces us to Molly (the cancer patient with whom we’ve been narratively conditioned to sympathize) as she’s reeling from the diagnosis and acting up. Molly abandons the therapy session and uses Steve’s credit card to book an expensive hotel room, intending to have sex with someone else. Shortly thereafter, she leaves him and lands on Nikki’s doorstep. Undaunted by the news that Nikki has just moved in with her new boyfriend (and his daughter!) and scored a role in a play she loves, Molly asks Nikki if she can die with her instead.\\n\\nThose are aren’t especially virtuous choices, but (as written) they swiftly set Molly up as a fascinating but thoroughly imperfect character. Those closest to her must roll with her impulsivity and need as well as her charm, stoicism and broad-mindedness. And Nikki does. But shepherding a cancer patient through treatment and grief and old sexual trauma — and the pursuit of sexual satisfaction — isn’t easy. Nikki loses virtually everything over the course of the series; Slate starts to literally droop under the weight of all her character takes on, but never in Molly’s presence. The labor she puts into keeping things light and meeting Molly exactly where she is — burying her own grief as best she can — puts a heroic twist on the comedy. Every laugh makes it more of a love story.\\n\\nMy one criticism of a script that largely appreciates humans in all their flawed complexity is that it paints too saintly a picture of Nikki while leaning fearlessly into Molly’s flaws. A charming, disorganized firecracker with an atrocious temper and no filter to speak of (Slate is a delight), Nikki’s endless patience with Molly — even when she infects her laptop with viruses while chatting with sketchy cam guys — stretches credulity.\\n\\nWilliams, always a powerhouse, captures Molly’s arc from overall-wearing cancer patient to warm, be-stilettoed domme with wicked charisma and exquisite sensitivity. She humanizes Molly’s single-mindedness (which isn’t always attractive) and makes apparently contradictory qualities seem compatible. Molly’s settled, uncompromising firmness on certain fronts coexists with her trembling hope, her risk-taking and her many small, extremely entertaining epiphanies.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI would dwell on Delaney’s wild chemistry with Williams as Molly (he plays her misanthropic neighbor), but I don’t want to give too much away. Suffice to say Delaney has rarely been better, and this is one of those shows where everyone vibes a little with everyone else. Molly’s winsome promiscuity somehow informs the tone of the whole production. As one character puts it while trying to disabuse her of the “early millennial” notion that sex is just about penetration and orgasms, “Sex is a wave. No, sex, sex is a mindset. Sex is the nonlinear emergent phenomenon that arises when two or more beings, they touch energy fields.”\\n\\nIt says something, though I’m not sure what, that I’ve deleted many similar paragraphs in the course of writing this review — about an unforgettable discussion of topping, a cataclysmic bit of erotic slapstick and a brutal mother-daughter exchange about guilt. Spoilers all but also evidence of what this hilarious, heavy, gentle, genre-bending Mixmaster of a show can do.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Justin Baldoni‘s lawyers responded Thursday to Blake Lively‘s attempt to throw out his defamation suit, arguing that a California law meant to protect harassment victims doesn’t apply to Lively’s “fabricated” claims.\\n\\nThe actor-director filed a $400 million lawsuit against Lively, his co-star, and her husband Ryan Reynolds in January, arguing that they set out to destroy his career and hijack his movie, “It Ends With Us,” with false allegations of harassment on set.\\n\\nIn a motion to dismiss the suit last month, Lively’s team argued that her allegations — which were first made in a California civil rights complaint that was shared with the New York Times — are protected by litigation privilege.\\n\\nPopular on Variety\\n\\nLively’s lawyers also invoked the Protecting Survivors from Weaponized Defamation Lawsuits Act, a 2023 law that protects harassment accusers from retaliatory defamation suits. The law provides immunity from suit and allows a prevailing defendant to claim attorneys’ fees and damages.\\n\\nIn response on Thursday, Baldoni’s lawyers noted that the protection applies only to harassment claims with a “reasonable basis” that are made “without malice.” They argue that Lively in fact made up the allegations, and that therefore the law does not apply.\\n\\n“Lively fabricated her allegations of sexual harassment, either wholesale or by exaggerating benign (and not harassing) interactions in a concerted, malicious effort to seize control of the Film and later to restore her reputation after a well-publicized series of marketing missteps that sullied her reputation,” Baldoni’s lawyers argue.\\n\\nBaldoni’s lead lawyer, Bryan Freedman, said in a statement that Lively’s team is attempting to set a “dangerous precedent” by using the law to undermine Baldoni’s right to sue under the First Amendment.\\n\\n“Ms. Lively and her circle of Hollywood elites cannot prevent my clients from exercising their constitutional right to petition the court to clear their names from her false and harmful claims,” Freedman said. “This right protects not only Mr. Baldoni and the Wayfarer parties in this particular case, but all Americans in the future who have false accusations levied against them and seek relief from our justice system. This must stop here, and we will continue to fight against this blatant attempt to block access to the court system and to weaken our nation’s Constitution to serve those who are in the position of power.”\\n\\nThe response also contends that the litigation privilege does not apply because Lively first made the allegations well in advance of lodging the civil rights complaint.\\n\\nBaldoni’s team also cites an interview Lively gave at the 2022 Forbes Power Women’s summit, which they argue supports their contention that she intended to seize creative control of the movie. In the interview, Lively stated that when she was starting out as as actor, “I knew that they just wanted me to show up and look cute and stand on a little pink sticker where I’m supposed to go and say what I’m supposed to say.\\n\\n“But I also knew that like that wasn’t fulfilling for me — that I wanted to be part of the storytelling . . .. And sometimes I would have people who really resented that because they were like, ‘we just hired you to be an actor,'” she continued. “I wouldn’t reveal that I actually need to have authorship in order to feel fulfilled. So, I think that for them, sometimes that might have felt like a rug pull because you’re like, you’re trying to assert yourself into something that we didn’t hire you to.”\\n\\nBaldoni’s team argues: “That is exactly what happened on the set of ‘It Ends With Us.'”\",\n",

       "  'text': 'The unique genetic change that turned horses into athletic powerhouses\\n\\ntoggle caption Darrell Gulin/Getty Images/The Image Bank RF\\n\\nGianni Castiglione did not set out to study horses.\\n\\nThe Vanderbilt University biologist and his colleagues were interested in how different animal species balance the need to produce energy with the harmful byproducts of that production.\\n\\n\"To make energy, we\\'ve made a deal with the devil to, basically, have a slow burning fire in our cells,\" he said. That fire essentially burns oxygen to create energy. But that kicks up a lot of smoke, or oxidative stress, that can harm cells.\\n\\nHorses, it turns out, have evolved an unusual way of regulating this tradeoff that allows them to produce more energy without incurring more cellular damage, researchers report in the journal Science. Those genetic changes may, in part, explain how horses became such powerful athletes, able to outrun and outlast virtually all other animals.\\n\\nSponsor Message\\n\\n\"Horses can make this fire burn even hotter and make the damage even less than it would be in a species like a human,\" said Castiglione.\\n\\nThe changes occurred in a key gene pathway called NRF2/KEAP1. The pathway senses the buildup of oxidative stress and then kickstarts antioxidant production, which can clean it up, said Castiglione. \"This is essentially the energy production and fire department, all wrapped in one.\"\\n\\nCastiglione and his colleagues were scanning the genomes of nearly 200 mammalian species looking for unusual variants in this pathway. Horses stuck out with a single, highly unusual mutation.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a type of mutation called a nonsense mutation,\" he said. \"That\\'s because it breaks a gene, it inactivates it from doing what the cell needs it to do.\" It basically put a stop sign, called a stop codon, toward the beginning of the KEAP1 gene. Stop codons generally signal where a gene ends, so having one at the start would \"break\" the gene.\\n\\nThis mutation kills mice, probably because it allows too much \"smoke\" to build up in cells. So Castiglione was stumped. \"We thought, wow, how are horses dealing with this?\"\\n\\nThrough a variety of genomic and molecular techniques, the researchers found an answer.\\n\\nSponsor Message\\n\\n\"Horses have evolved a very intricate strategy for working around this stop codon,\" said Elia Duh, a study co-author and molecular biologist at Johns Hopkins University. Essentially, a suite of mutations allows them to ignore the stop sign, making the gene work, but in a slightly different way that ends up benefiting the horses.\\n\\nThe researchers found that these mutations, which arose in the ancestors of all modern horses, allow their muscle cells to produce up to five times more energy than mouse cells, while simultaneously ramping up their damage-control system by 200%.\\n\\n\"This provides them with the biochemical means to run fast and over long distances,\" said Duh. This ultimately helps them become aerobic powerhouses.\\n\\n\"I really love this paper,\" said Samantha Brooks, a horse genetics researcher at the University of Florida. The mutation, she said, \"should have caused a catastrophic loss of function for this protein. But instead, the ancestors of these species somehow managed to really turn that lemon into lemonade.\"\\n\\nThe way they made lemonade — ignoring a stop codon — has only previously been reported in viruses, the researchers say.\\n\\nThis adaptation could have implications for human health. Many inherited diseases, like cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy, stem from stop codons arising in important genes. If researchers can better understand how horses manage to ignore such stop codons, said Duh, perhaps they could develop gene therapies that do just that in humans, too.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Nothing in life comes free, not even a sugar-free drink.\\n\\nScientists have now linked the artificial sweetener sucralose (sold as Splenda) to yet another potential health downside – and this time, the impact is not in the gut; it\\'s in the brain.\\n\\nIn a randomized crossover trial, when a group of 75 adults drank a beverage containing sucralose, they showed heightened blood flow to the hypothalamus – a part of the brain that helps control appetite and cravings.\\n\\nBy contrast, when the same participants drank a beverage with sucrose (aka table sugar), there was a hunger-dampening effect. Peripheral glucose levels spiked, and this corresponded with reduced blood flow to the hypothalamus.\\n\\nTwo hours after drinking sucrose, participants reported significantly lower hunger levels than after they drank sucralose.\\n\\nThe findings, which are supported by initial research on rodents, suggest that non-caloric sweeteners may not actually be useful for losing weight or for reducing sugar cravings in the long run. In fact, they seem to change how the hypothalamus communicates with other parts of the brain.\\n\\nSucralose is 600 times sweeter than sucrose but with zero calories. This may create \"a mismatch between the expectation of caloric intake and the absence of actual energy\", the authors explain.\\n\\n\"If your body is expecting a calorie because of the sweetness, but doesn\\'t get the calorie it\\'s expecting, that could change the way the brain is primed to crave those substances over time,\" warns a supervisor of the study, endocrinologist Kathleen Alanna Page from the University of Southern California.\\n\\nPage and her team say it is vital that the long-term health impacts of Splenda and similar sweeteners are investigated with further research, especially since as many as 40 percent of American adults regularly consume these sugar substitutes.\\n\\nThe recent trial included 75 participants between the ages of 18 and 35 who underwent three interventions each, receiving blood tests and brain scans before and after.\\n\\nOne day, they drank a beverage with sucralose. Another day, they drank a beverage with sucrose. And on a third day, they drank a glass of water. All the drinks had an unsweetened cherry flavor so the participants didn\\'t know the difference. Each person served as their own control.\\n\\nThe order of the drinks was randomized for each participant, and the gap between sessions was anywhere from two days to two months.\\n\\nUnlike drinking real sugar, drinking sucralose did not cause a spike in peripheral glucose levels, or hormones like insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which help control blood sugar levels.\\n\\n\"The body uses these hormones to tell the brain you\\'ve consumed calories, in order to decrease hunger,\" explains Page. \"Sucralose did not have that effect – and the differences in hormone responses to sucralose compared to sugar were even more pronounced in participants with obesity.\"\\n\\nThis suggests that metabolic signals in the body are closely tied to brain activity. When sucralose interacts with gut microbes, for instance, previous studies have found it can impair the body\\'s response to glucose. Perhaps this is also feeding into the unique hypothalamic response identified in the current research.\\n\\nOnce, Splenda was considered biologically inert, but recent studies have found concerning signs that this popular sugar substitute, often found in diet drinks and chewing gum, is linked to DNA damage, impairments in glucose tolerance, and an altered gut microbiome.\\n\\nTwo years after the World Health Organization issued a health warning about sucralose and its possible metabolic and inflammatory impacts, we have yet another reason to worry about consuming the sweetener willy-nilly.\\n\\nPage and her colleagues are now conducting a follow-up study to see how sucralose impacts the brains of children and adolescents specifically.\\n\\n\"Are these substances leading to changes in the developing brains of children who are at risk for obesity?\" asks Page.\\n\\n\"The brain is vulnerable during this time, so it could be a critical opportunity to intervene.\"\\n\\nThe study was published in Nature Metabolism.',\n",

       "  'publish_date': datetime.datetime(2025, 4, 3, 0, 0),\n",
       "  'text': 'Dr. Adam Ratner has heard a lot of myths and misunderstandings about measles in his decades as a New York City pediatric infectious disease specialist.\\n\\nA troubling untruth he’s seen circulating on social media during the current outbreak is that being infected with the virus instead of getting vaccinated confers benefits on the immune system — a strength-training program of sorts for the cells.\\n\\nThe truth, Ratner said, “is exactly the opposite.”\\n\\nMeasles is a highly contagious virus that presents as a rash and cold-like symptoms for many patients, and can lead to serious or fatal complications for others. An outbreak that began in west Texas in January has since infected nearly 500 people across 19 states, including eight people in California.\\n\\nAn insidious but lesser-known consequence of even a mild measles infection is that it kills the very cells that remember which pathogens the patient has previously fought and how those battles were won. As a result, recurring bugs that might have caused only minor symptoms make patients as sick as if they’d never encountered them before.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMeasles destroys lymphocytes that defend against other bugs to make way for ones that defend against measles, an immunity won at the cost of other protections.\\n\\nThis “immune amnesia,” physicians say, leaves patients vulnerable to reccurrences of diseases their immune cells were previously able to resist.\\n\\nIf a child gets sick with measles, “for the next two or three years, you kind of have to be looking over your kid’s shoulder, wondering if some otherwise routine virus or bacteria that they should be very well protected against is potentially going to land them in the hospital,” said Dr. Michael Mina, an epidemiologist who was previously an assistant professor of immunology and infectious diseases at Harvard Medical School.\\n\\n“Even if your measles virus infection seemed mild and you kind of blew through it, it doesn’t mean that it was mild on your immune system,” Mina added.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTake rotavirus, Ratner said, which causes severe diarrhea that can be life-threatening for children if untreated. A child who has rotavirus once will have antibodies that offer protection against future infections.\\n\\nBut a measles infection, said Ratner, author of the recent book “Booster Shots: The Urgent Lessons of Measles and the Uncertain Future of Children’s Health,“ “could wipe out that immunity and they could be just as vulnerable to rotavirus as if they had never seen it before.”\\n\\nImmune amnesia results from the measles virus’ plan of attack. Viral particles travel via airborne droplets of saliva, mucus and cells that make their way into a new body when their unsuspecting host breathes them in.\\n\\nFrom there, they sneak past the protective barrier lining the respiratory system and head to the lymph nodes in search of cells that express a particular protein called signaling lymphocytic activation molecule, or SLAM.\\n\\nThe virus then rides around the bloodstream on these hijacked SLAM-expressing cells, further infecting and destroying other SLAM expressers it meets on the way.\\n\\nAmong the SLAM-expressing cells that measles wrecks are memory B and T cells, two crucial players in a functioning immune system. Memory B cells manufacture the right antibodies quickly when a familiar microbe appears. Memory T cells recognize and kill viruses that your cells have encountered in the past.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nA measles infection feeds on these memory cells. Vaccines, in contrast, stimulate the production of memory B and T cells without consuming others in the process.\\n\\nThis was not yet understood in the decades before the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine’s approval in 1963, when measles was a common childhood disease that killed some 400 children in the U.S. each year.\\n\\n“For 100 years or more, we’ve known that measles does cause an acute susceptibility to other infections,” Mina said.\\n\\nA measles infection temporarily suppresses the immune system, Mina said, and it was long assumed that opportunistic infections around the time of the illness were the result of that short-term suppression.\\n\\nIn 2015, Mina and colleagues published a paper that looked at mortality data in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Denmark before and after measles vaccines were introduced. They found that whenever there were measles outbreaks, childhood deaths from all other infectious diseases remained significantly higher for two to three years in outbreak locations, an increase that accounted for up to half of all childhood deaths from infectious disease.\\n\\nOnce those countries rolled out the MMR vaccine, measles cases fell, as expected. But so did childhood deaths from other infectious diseases, by about half.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThree years later, Mina and his collaborators took blood samples from 77 unvaccinated children in a community in the Netherlands before and then two to six months after the children contracted measles. They found that the virus wiped out 11% to 73% of the children’s preexisting antibodies to a host of pathogens.\\n\\nJust as children in preschool fall ill constantly with common diseases they’re encountering for the first time, unvaccinated children who contract measles are at higher risk in the ensuing years for common early childhood sicknesses such as respiratory infections, earaches and viruses that cause diarrhea, said Shelly Bolotin, a scientist at Public Health Ontario in Canada and director of the Center for Vaccine Preventable Diseases at the University of Toronto.\\n\\n“In order to correct that depletion [of B and T cells], you need to be reexposed to everything you were immune to before, and this can take years,” she said.\\n\\nAs of late March, 97% of the people sickened in the current outbreak were unvaccinated or didn’t disclose their vaccine status. The measles virus is attenuated in the MMR vaccine, meaning that it has been altered to produce the appropriate immune response without triggering the disease itself. In the case of measles, that means no mass destruction of the cells that hold the immune system’s memory.\\n\\n“It doesn’t have this very, very damaging effect, which is why we recommend vaccination, because we get all of the immunity with none of the adverse consequences,” Bolotin said.\\n\\n',\n",
