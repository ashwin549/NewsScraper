    "Within 48 hours later, those efforts were not merely standing. They had worked — at least in one case.\\n\\nThe major law firm of Paul, Weiss, \n",
    "Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison (called Paul, Weiss), targeted by President Trump in an executive order, opted to mollify rather than confront the president. \n",
    "In short, it backed down.\\n\\nDemocrats, as well as many lawyers, are grappling with the implications.\\n\\nPaul, Weiss agreed to provide $40 million in pro \n",

    "concessions, and some others, Trump agreed to lift an executive order that would have taken away security clearances from the law firm’s staff.\\n\\n\n",
    "On social media, critics accuse the law firm of giving in to a “shakedown” or “extortion” by Trump.\\n\\nThe firm’s chair, Brad Karp, defended the deal he \n",
    "struck in an email to all employees, according to The New York Times.\\n\\nKarp reportedly argued he had merely “reaffirmed” the firm’s principles. Others \n",
    "have noted that the $40 million pro bono commitment amounts to only about one-fifth of the pro-bono work the massive firm typically does each year.\\n\\n\n",
    "That being said, the appearance of appearing to bend the knee to Trump with such alacrity has caused widespread alarm in legal circles.\\n\\n\n",
    "Prominent attorney Mark Zaid told this column that a “horrible message” was being sent both to the legal profession and to the public at large by Paul, \n",
    "Weiss’s “decision to simply capitulate in fear rather than stand up for the rule of law and the ethical principles that guide lawyers.”\\n\\n\n",

    "the firm that represented the presidential campaign of 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nIn that capacity, it contracted another organization \n",
    "called Fusion GPS to do opposition research on Trump. Fusion GPS in turn sought the assistance of retired British spy Christopher Steele, who produced \n",
    "the now-infamous “Steele dossier.”\\n\\nThis history appears to have drawn the lasting enmity of Trump.\\n\\nBut Perkins Coie — unlike Paul, Weiss — \n",

    "middle ground in which it is neither challenging the president so publicly as Perkins Coie, nor accommodating him like Paul, Weiss.\\n\\n\n",
    "For all three legal firms — and for others eyeing these developments with alarm — there is a near-certainty that they would lose significant numbers of \n",

    "the firm’s clients — a massive pressure point that could call the firm’s existence into question.\\n\\nBut Democrats and other Trump critics worry about a \n",
    "broader attempt to squelch dissent.\\n\\nPart of that, to be sure, is concentrated in the legal sphere.\\n\\nTrump has called for the impeachment of the judge \n",
    "who ruled against him when his administration used the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants last weekend. Elon Musk referred to a separate \n",
    "adverse ruling — this one blocking a ban on openly transgender people serving in the military — as a “judicial coup.”\\n\\n\n",
